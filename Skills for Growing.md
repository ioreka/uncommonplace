While learning the information here, I suggest you also learn to ignore a lot of common advice, including the 'helpful tips' on social media and from friends or neighbours. They mean well, but are often repeating old knowledge which we can improve on.

Try things out, be happy to make mistakes, but above all have a go. Always have seeds ready and raise plenty though summer, to keep filling those gaps. #persistence #mistakes 

A key role of compost is to stimulate soil bbiology, which then makes nutrients available. Of itself, compost is not a fertiliser, in that most of its nutrients are not water soluble and need biollogy, such as mycorrhizal fungi, to make them available for plants. #compost #soil #ecology

A golden rule: seeds and seedlings in a small container succeed better than the same number in a large container. This has to do with two factors: 1, large volumes of compost and soil with few roots are more likely to be too wet and lacking air. 2, Seedlings grow better when close to other seedlings, their companions.

In spring, later sowings catch up. After midsummer, they don't. This is thanks to decining light levels and then falling temperatures. One day's growth in July would need two days in August, four in September, a week in October, half of November, and the whole of December.

It's an act of faith, dropping tiny seeds into empty spaces. I still worry about them, even after doing it so many times.

Good spacing is at the balance point of allowing enough room for successful growth and harvest without wasint growing space. #balance #gaps-and-spaces #growth 

May you enjoy your gardening. The plants will notice your thoughts and commitment, and be comfortable about you. In return, they can support you.
