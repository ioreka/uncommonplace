You should imagine a tree that has an inverted triangular, or conical, shape from far away, and very irregular inside. Now imagine sitting on a branch on top of the tree. You are the top because you're alive now (not because you are superior), and around you are all the other organisms that are alive now. Close to you are your living cousins, such as chimpanzees and cats. Further away, as you look horizontally across the top of the tree, you'll see animals that are more distantly related. The total "tree of life" also includes plants and bacteria and protozoa.

Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals. Because our most recent common ancestor was so simple and lies so far back, cephalopods are an _independent experiment_ in the evolution of large brains and complex behaviour. If we can make _contact_ with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of a shared history, not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.
#intelligence #self-and-other 

Philosophy is among the least corporeal of callings. It is, or can be, a purely mental sort of life. It has no equipment that needs managing, no sites or field stations. There's nothing wrong with that - the same is true of mathematics or poetry. But the bodily side of this project has been an important side. I came across the cephalopods by change, by spending time in the water.
#cartesian-duality 

The Earth is about 4.5 billion years old, and life itself began perhaps 3.8 billion years ago. Animals arrived much later - perhaps a billion years ago, but probably some time after that. For most of life's history, then, there was life but no animals. What we had, over vast stretches of time, was a world of single-celled organisms in the sea. Much of life today goes on in exactly that form.
#the-sea 

A bacterium is so small that its sensors alone can give it no indication of the direction that a good or bad chemical is coming from. To overcome this problem, the bacterium uses time to help it deal with space. The cell is not interested in how much of a chemical is present at any given moment, but rather in whether that concentration is increasing or decreasing. After all, if the cell swam in a straight line simple because the concentration of a desirable chemical was high, it might travel away from chemical nirvana, not toward it, depending on the direction it's pointing. the bacterium soles this problem in an ingenious manner: as it senses its world, one mechanisms registers what conditions are like right now, and another records how things were a few moments ago. The bacterium will swim in a straight line as long as the chemicals it senses seem _better_ now than those it sensed a moment ago. If not, it's preferable to change course.
#feedback 

The chemistry of life is an aquatic chemistry. We can get by on land only by carrying a huge amount of salt water around with us. Any many of the evolutionary moves made at these early stages - those giving birth to sensing, behavior, and coordination - would have depended on the sea's free movement of chemicals.

In the Ediacaran, other animals might be there around you, without being especially relevant. In the Cambrian, each animal becomes an important part of the environment of others. This entanglement of one life in another, and its evolutionary consequences, is due to behavior and the mechanisms controlling it. _From this point on, the mind evolved in response to other minds._

An image-forming eye makes possible actions that would be unthinkable without it.

To completely forgo both skeleton and shell is an unusual evolutionary move for a creature of this size and complexity. An octopus has almost no hard parts at all - its eyes and beak are the largest - and as a result it can squeeze through a hole about the size of its eyeball and transform its body shape almost indefinitely. The evolution of cephalopods yielded, in the octopus, a body of pure possibility.
#the-body 

Absolute size is important, but it is usually regarded as less informative than relative size - the size of the brain as a fraction of the size of the body. This tells us how much an animal is "investing" in its brain. This comparison is made by weight, and only counts the neurons in the brain. Octopuses also score highly by this measure, roughly in the range of vertebrates, though not as highly as mammals. Biologists regard al these assessments of size, though, as only a very rough guide to the brain _power_ an animal has. Some brains are organized differently from others, with more or fewer synapses, and those synapses can also be more or less complicated. The most startling finding in recent work on animal intelligence is how smart some birds are, especially parrots and crows. Birds have quite small brains in absolute terms, but very high-powered ones.

When we try to compare one animal's brainpower with another's, we also run into the fact that there is no single scale on which intelligence can be sensibly measured. Different animals are good at different things, as makes sense given the different lives they lead. An analogy can be drawn with tool kits: brains are tool kits for the control of behaviour. As with human tool kits, there are some elements in common across many trades, but much diversity also.

The octopus's loss of almost all hard parts compounded both the challenge and the opportunities. A vast range of movements became possible, but they had to be organized, had to be made coherent. Octopuses have not dealt with this challenge by imposing centralized governance on the body; rather, they have fashioned a mixture of local and central control. 

The octopus is sometimes said to be a good illustration of a theoretical movement in psychology known as "embodied cognition". These ideas were not developed to apply to octopuses, but to animals in general, including ourselves, and this view has also been influenced by robotics.
#humans-and-machines 

The octopus, indeed, has a "different embodiment", but once so unusual that it does not fit any of the standard views in this area. The usual debate is between those who see the brain as a CEO and those who emphasize the intelligence stored in the body itself. Both views rely on a distinction between brain-based and body-based knowledge. The octopus lives outside both the usual pictures.
#paradigm 

Milner & Goodale: They aregue that there are two "streams" by which visual information moves through the brain. The _ventral stream_, which takes a lower path through the brain, is concerned with categorisation, recognition, and description of objects. The _dorsal stream_, which runs above it, closer to the top of the head, is concerned with real-time navigation through space (avoiding obstacles as you walk, getting the letter through the slot).

They think that the activity in our brains that leads to visual experience is the building of a coherent "inner model" of the world. It's certainly reasonable to think that building an integrated model of this kind has effects on subjective experience. But perhaps without such a model there is no subjective experience at all?

Sentience has some _point_ to it. It's not just a bathing in living activity.
#sentience 

An octopus is, first, an organism with a large nervous system and a complex active body. It has rich sensory capacities and extraordinary capacities for behavior. If there is a form of subjective experience that comes along with sensing and acting in a living system, an octopus has plenty of that. But that's not all. In elusive and alien form, the octopus has some of the sophistications, some of the steps beyond the basics.

Octopuses, of at least some species, have an opportunistic, exploratory style of interaction with the world. They are curious, embracing novelty, protean in behavior as well as body. These features are reminiscent of what Stanislaus Dehane associates with consciousness in human mental life. As he says, the demands of novelty jolt us from unconscious routine into conscious reflection.
#reflection #reflexive-praxis 

Different animals have independently evolved perceptual constancies. Though in some ways they much see the world very differently from us, octopuses seem to deal with the world by identifying and re-identifying objects, and to have some grip on a distinction between self and other. 
#attention #self-and-other #self-awareness 

The octopus may be in a soft of hybrid situation. For an octopus, its arms are partly _self_ - they can be directed and used to manipulate things. But from the central brain's perspective, they are partly _non-self_ too, partly agents of their own.

In the octopus's case there is a conductor, the central brain. But the players it conducts are jazz players, inclined to improvisation, who will only direct so much direction. Or perhaps they are players who receive only rough, general instructions from the conductor, who trusts them to play something that works.
#trust #coordination 

Chameleons are the familiar example. But cephalopods are faster and provide a wider range of colors. In the case of large cuttlefish, the entire body is a screen on which patterns are being played. The patterns are not just a series of snapshots, but moving shapes, like stripes and clouds. These seem to be immensely _expressive_ animals, animals with a lot to say. If so, what is being said, and to whom?
#communication #non-verbal-communication 

Compare the baboons with the cephalopods. In baboons, the production side of their vocal communication system is very simple. there are only three or four calls. An individual's choices are limited, and a call will reliably follow interactions of a particular kind. The _interpretation_ side, though, is complex, because calls are produced in ways that allow a narrative to be put together. The baboons have simple production, complex interpretation. The cephalopods are the opposite. The production side is vastly, almost indefinitely complex, with millions of pixels on the skin and a huge number of patterns that might be produced at each moment. As a communication channel, the bandwidth of this system is extraordinary. You could say _anything_ with it - if you had a way to encode the messages, and if anyone was listening.

Evolution is not heading anywhere, not toward us or anyone else. 

Ordinary speech, saying things and hearing them, plays an organizational role in our lives - it helps us put ideas together, draw attention to things, get actions to occur in the right order. Vygotsky thought that as children acquire their spoken language, they also acquire inner speech; a child's language "branches" into inner and outer forms. Inner speech for Vygotsky is not merely an unspoken version of ordinary speech, but something with its own thoughts and patterns. This inner tool makes possible organized thought.
#cognition #organisation #neurolinguistic-programming #linguistics 

Initially, this view might seem inevitable - that complex thought, with its movement from premise to conclusion, step to step, must require language or something close to it. It seems that organized internal processing could not take place without it. 
But once we make that last statement, we're saying something that's not true. It has become clear now that very complex things go on inside other animals without the aid of speech.

Language provides a medium for the arrangement and manipulation of ideas.
#language 

The sounds we cook up in our heads, including the sounds of words, are _broadcast_ in our minds in something like the way that many ordinary perceptual experiences are broadcast. Once a sentence of inner speech is composed, it is exposed to the same sort of processing that would apply to a sentence we hear.

Inner speech, and the sketches and shapes that inner language tangles with, have huge effects on subjective experience. Any ordinary human has at his or her disposal a field for the performance of countless invisible actions. The echoes and commentary, the chatter and cajoling, are as vivid as anything in our inner lives. You can be sitting motionless, watching an unchanging scene, and your mind can be _alive_ with this stuff, teeming with it in a great jumble. Inner speech is so subjectively prominent, for many people, that it can be overwhelming: the endless chatter is something people use medication to get _away_ from.

Bernard Baars tried to explain conscious thought in terms of an inner "global workspace", where lots of information can be brought together. As Baars saw it, most of what happens in our brains does on unconsciously, but a small fraction of it can be made conscious by being brought into this workspace.

Inner speech provides one way we are able to route things through our minds in such a way that information can be assessed and used. Inner speech does not live in a little box in your brain; inner speech is _a way your brain creates a loop_, intertwining the construction of thoughts and the reception of them. And when that's done, the format provided by language allows you to being ideas together in an organized structure.
#problemsolving #process #processing 

We often reflect on our inner states by forming inner questions, commentaries, and exhortations about them, and this is not idle or merely recreational; it can help us do things we'd otherwise not be able to do.
#reflexive-praxis #growth #pursuit-of-knowledge 

The nervous system arose through one internalization of sensing and signaling, and the internalization of language as a tool for thinking was another. In both cases, a means of communication between organisms became a means of communication within them. These two events bookmark a cognitive evolution as it has occurred to date - one near its outset and one in recent times. The recent one is not near the "end" of the process, but it is near the end of the process as it has run thus far.

When a written message is directed at others, it's ordinary communication. When you write something for yourself to read, there's usually an essential role for time - the goal is memory, in a broad sense. But memory of this kind _is_ a communicative phenomenon; it is communication between your present self and a future self. Diaries and notes-to-self are embedded in a sender/receiver system, just like more standardised kinds of communication.

The cephalopods' situation is reminiscent of Ridley Scott's movie _Blade Runner_, in which a class of artificial but human-like "replicants" are programmed to die after only four years. (In the book by Philip K Dick on which the film was based, _Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?_, their early deaths are due to breakdown.) _Blade Runner_'s replicants, unlike cephalopods, know their fate.
#death #life-and-death #fate-and-fortune 

In animals, birth and death have come to exist as boundaries that mark out an individual life, even though cells are continually coming and going, and even though the cells' lineages extend before us and after us. So again we face the problem. Why do hummingbirds live till they are ten, rookfish till they are two hundred, bristlecone pines until they are thousands of years old, and octopuses until they are two? 

The mind evolved in the sea. Water made it possible. All the early stages took place in water: the origin of life, the birth of animals, the evolution of nervous systems and brains, the appearance of the complex bodies that make brains worth having.

When animals did crawl onto dry land, they took the sea with them. All the basic activities of life occur in water-filled cells bounded by membranes, tiny containers whose insides are remnants of the sea.

Given the economic importance of bees as pollinators, the cause of the "collapses" has been intensely studied. But the collapse came on pretty quickly. Is it a parasite? A fungus? Chemical toxins? When I asked Barron, he said: Yes, they are starting to get a handle on what's going on. So what's the factor that's causing it? He replied that as far as they can tell there is _no_ single factor. Instead, over many years, more and more small stresses have appeared in the lives of bees: more pollutants, more new microorganisms, less habitat. For a long while, as these stresses accumulated, bees were able to cope. Colonies absorbed the stress by working harder. Although they weren't obviously and visibly suffering, the capacity of the bees to buffer these problems was being slowly worn out. Eventually a critical point was reached, and honeybee colonies just started to fail. They failed dramatically - visibly - not because some sudden pest had swept through, but because their capacity to absorb the stresses had run out.
