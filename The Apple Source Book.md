You could eat a different kind of apple every day for more than six years and still not come to the end of the varieties we can grow in the British Isles
#apples

Many apples are traceable to their orchards, woods, hedges and gardens of origin. Since a variety can only be perpetuated by grafting, or the tree being left to grow up again after it has fallen, our relationship with it keeps it alive.

A tree that should carry Mary Ann Brailsford's name was planted by her as a pip in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, at the start of the nineteenth century. This is the mother of all Bramleys, named after the man who inherited her tree. Every pie made with Bramleys comes from from a tree that originated as a graft, or a graft of a graft, from this single tree.

The individual geographies and histories of apples are not merely interesting, they are fragments of knowledge from which a future can be made.

According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' own figures, between 2001-2004 a further 12,000 acres, or 21% of the area that once grew the most popular cooking and eating varieties, went out of production [...] this is on top of the 57% of our orchards that have been grubbed up and burned during the Second World War.

Apples have been grown here for more than two thousand years. It is the quintessentially English fruit, not only forming a rich part of our culinary and orcharding traditions but, at blossom time, showing how traditional orchards are a vital part of our landscape. They are a precious and beautiful sight, with deep historical and cultural resonance, that unites communities, provides habitats for wild life and food and drink for humans.

Orchards are like wood pasture, full of micro-habitats, their biodiversity no less rich for having been maintained by many hands. They tell the seasons frankly, flaunting blossom, dropping fruit, enticing creatures large and small, enjoying winter wassailing. They display an intricacy of particularity to place.

Had our forebears set out to create havens for wild life, they could hardly have bettered traditional orchards. Nature revels in the sheer variety of these places. Orchards defy tidy categorisation - neither woodland, grassland, hedgerow nor wood pasture, they have rarely featureed in habitat surveys. Yet the wonder of these places is that they can be all of these habitats at once.

James Marsden - "Diversity offers intrinsic protection against pests."

Philippa Davenport -  "Common Ground has done sterling work in alerting us to the perils: the destruction of orchards and the wildlife they support, the replacement of biodiversity with monocultural mediocrity, and the bludgeoning of local culture and cooking. Now, it is up to us. Every one of us. We are all responsible and each of us has the power to make a difference. Individually our voices and our purchasing power may be slight, but jointly we can halt and perhaps reverse the trend - if we are sufficiently vociferous and if we persevere."
