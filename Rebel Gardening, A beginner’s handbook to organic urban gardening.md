To save seeds is to preserve food culture. Heirloom crops wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for the gardeners who meticulously grew and saved seeds in the past.

We are not born knowing how to grow but we are born knowing how to naturally look after and care for things. It builds relationships and bonds and reminds me of my grandpa every time I am out in my little garden.

How funny that gardening used to be the lifeblood of our existence and now it is seen as rebellious as we are doing something so different. We’re not going to the store and falling in line; we are instead experimenting and breathing life into the tiny streets of big cities.

Around 5.6 billion pounds of chemical insecticides are used worldwide each year. The majority of sprayed pesticides may be removed from the surface of fruit and veggies through washing, but some are systemic, meaning they are absorbed into your fruit and vegetables during the growing process.

A great advantage to growing in small spaces is that you can use the shade to your advantage to benefit plants that grow well in shade. If you grow cucumbers vertically in a trellis like I have done, you could potentially grow lettuce in pots and move them around in the summer following the shade created by your trellis. This is a bit like people sitting around the pool on holiday, chasing the sun or the shade as the sun moves.

I keep going back to this, but planning really is key to getting the most out of your small space.

Normally, in a raised bed, the roots will grow into 40–50 per cent of the depth, which means 50–60 per cent of your raised bed isn’t being used. This is where Hugelkultur comes into play and you can save a lot of money. It is nothing more than filling up the bottom layer of your raised beds with rotting food and wood.

One of the benefits of compost is that it retains water, but once the wooden pieces have decomposed they turn into huge sponges and are going to retain a lot more water than compost. This in turn means that you will need to water your raised beds less, which is always a winner!

There is a micro universe underneath your soil and every time you dig you will disturb the micro- and macro-organisms. Plants interact with mycelium (a fungal network), creating symbiotic relationships. This creates a healthy ecosystem in your soil, which helps your plants to thrive. Every time you dig, you disturb them and potentially damage them. It is amazing what goes on and in our soil – nature is rather marvellous.

There are lots of other ways out there to do something like this, but the most important part for me is to recycle. If we all do tiny bits it can lead to big change.

Whether we use them to grow cereals, herbs, fruits or vegetables, seeds are an important part of our lives.

Because there are over a million varieties of seeds, it is difficult to isolate a specific type of seed.

Across the globe, there are more than 1,000 seed banks, each with a unique mission and scope. Around 40 per cent of the world’s plant species are at risk of extinction, according to estimates. A seed bank serves as a type of insurance, allowing us to save as many species as possible from extinction.

To maintain food traditions, it is important to store seeds. Without the gardeners who diligently nurtured and conserved seeds, heirloom crops would not exist.

Saving seeds is also essential to preserve food sovereignty. To put it another way, seed sovereignty is the right of farmers, gardeners and other food producers to keep and use, breed, exchange and sell open-source seeds. Genetically engineered, patented or seeds controlled by a company are not considered to be “open source”.

The present worldwide problems of COVID-19 and climate change have increased the importance of food sovereignty as a means of empowering communities toward self-determination and sustainability. The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted supply lines and made many of us realize how reliant we are on distant systems that are beyond our control. For a more sustainable future, it makes sense to save seeds and produce your own food. Using, storing and passing on seeds is a good way to ensure their long-term viability and your own independence.

Soil, contrary to common opinion, never needs to rest and it’s good to keep it planted out throughout the whole year, even if it’s just a cover crop with the sole purpose of accumulating carbon into the ground.

Saving and storing your own seeds is one of the most satisfying and empowering tasks in gardening. It gives you the satisfying feeling of a closed loop when you manage to grow a plant, harvest the fruit, compost the greens and save the seeds.

One of the main things I like to plan ahead of time is the support for my plants. You could potentially have the best seeds on the market, but without the appropriate care and a solid structure to support it, the plant’s growth and yield would be minimal.

If you are not sure, watch a few videos online to really understand what the different roots look like and ask questions. We all learn from others and people are always happy to pass on their knowledge.

Too many blackfly and greenfly, known as aphids, is a recurring issue every season for most gardeners, but what if we thought about it differently? Is it that we have too many aphids, but too few ladybirds? Do you have a mole problem, or simply not enough owls? Perhaps we need to install owl perches, where they can choose their dinner from?

In pest management, failure is part of the learning process, and you can always try again the following year and learn something new. I’ve lost many plants over the course of my gardening journey, but it is all part of the learning experience and I managed to unearth a lot of useful information.
