If you want to flick an ecological switch, dig a pond or lake!

Think about the orientation of the pond. The lake at Underhill is south-facing with substantial shelter to the north, east and west. It receives maximum sun, and this ensures that the water warms early in the spring season. Warm conditions are perfect for many dragonfly species and inviting for frogs and toads.  The reproductive cycle of these species is regulated in part by water temperature. Toads, for example, spawn when the water gets to about 9C.

All amphibians in the UK are endangered to some degree.

The historian Oliver Rackham claims that English lowland woods have been "managed" by humans for about 150 generations. Before then, megafauna like auroch, wild horses, bison and boar manipulated woodlands, creating and maintaining things like glades and wood meadows.

Log piles provide hibernating sites for toads in winter and they also attract wood mice, bank voles and wrens. And, of course, they are loved by invertebrates, for example woodlice, millipedes and centipedes.

I don't burn leftover cut wood - burning has no ecological value and releases particulates and carbon into the atmosphere.

Almost all classes of invertebrates are threatened to some degree - such is the devastating impact of land use change and the widespread use of herbicides and pesticides. 

If you are going to plant trees, think about species that attract the greatest range of invertebrates. (Higher numbers of invertebrate species will correspond with higher numbers of bird species.) Willows, oaks and birches can support upward of 400 species, with hawthorn, blackthorn and alter are also attractive to a wide range of insects. At the other end of the scale, sycamore, conifer and both horse and sweet chestnut support far fewer species. Do your research before you plant. 

Don't make your rides straight. Give them twists and turns - some more sweeping gentle, and others sharp and tight. Straight rides become unattractive wind tunnels to species like butterflies (and us!). Scallop the side edges, ie create deep bays. These spaces reduce wind flow and enable species like dragonflies to wait and ambush prey. An east-west orientation is ideal - this ensures that one side of the ride is shaded and the other in full sun. Stagger the sward lengths of the ride, so there is a succession of vegetation. 

I am now very careful about what I plant and how much I plant - summer droughts can undo a winter's work.

The value of high and broad hedgerows cannot be over-stated. They are the post-enclosure replacement for the scrubland that dominated much of the UK in deep prehistory, but that was destroyed during human colonisation. Scrubland that was home to once-abundant species like dormice, turtle doves, hedgehogs and nightingales was lost. 

Weeds are good, so leave them, let them flourish and watch what happens as your wilded patch is flooded with invertebrates and visited by seed-eating (granivorous) birds. Tidy is the enemy of nature and this especially applies to flora!

Inspired by the wilding project at Knepp, I have let the weeds at Underhill grow and take their place in the ecosystem. They play a central role in these ecosystems and are often misunderstood. Ragwort, for example, is demonised, and way too many untruths are written and told about this wonderful nature plant, with its vibrant yellow flower heads and sinuous growing stem. At least thirty insect species and fourteen fungi species are entirely reliant on this plant. Grazing animals have cohabited with ragwort for millennia in the UK, and what comes with this long cohabitation is knowledge. Ungulates know what to eat and what is going to kill them.

I strike a balance - areas are rotationally cut to ensure this type of reversion doesn't occur all over the land. I don't want Underhill to become a woodland; I want a place of variety and dynamism in terms of flora and fauna.

Barn owls are recognised as an indicator species - that is to say, their presence is a sign of the overall health and vitality of the habitat.

House martins and swallows like to nest not in direct sunlight but in cool, airy locations (north-facing eaves eg.)

One wondrous fact about female roe deer is that they delay their pregnancy. This biological strategy is called embryonic diapause. Bats in the UK have a similar biology.

Water shrews have a venomous saliva, which disables prey once bitten; such is the potency of the toxin that a single bite to a human can produce a nasty rash, or so i have read.

A single pipistrelle bat can eat up to three thousand insects per night, so a healthy source of invertebrates is critical.

Bats use visual markers like tree lines and hedgerows to navigate around the landscape, and if an entire line of trees disappears it destroys a key navigational marker.
