Though short, the novel is far from slight. It brings into sharp focus several of its author's enduring concerns, and draws on the same intellectual resources that illuminate her wider work: notably anthrpology, anarchism, feminism and Taoism. Characteristcally of all Le Guin's writing, it embodies the stubborn virtue of seeing with both eyes, in depth and in colour, without looking away from or ignoring uncomfortable truths.

The oppression that corrupts the oppressors is well enough known. That resistance to oppression can profoundly change those resisting, and for the worse, is less widely recognised - particularly among those who give that resistance their sympathy and solidarity. The ennobling aspect of resistance - of standing up, of fighting back, of driving the invader from the homeland - is seen and celebrated. The corrupting aspect - the hardening of the heart, the acceptance of casualty and atrocity, the replacement of the moral calculus with a cold-eyed calculation of advantage, of revenge and reprisal - is put out of mind, and sometimes for what seems the best of reasons. That too is part of the damage done.

In this tale, "The Word for World is Forest", which began as a pure pursuit of freedom and the dream, I succumbed, in part, to the lure of the pulpit. It is a very strong lure to a science fiction writer, who deals more directly than most novelists with ideas, whose metaphors are shaped by or embody ideas, and who therefore is always in danger of inextricably confusing ideas with opinions.

Breakfast in the Senoi house is like a dream clinic, with the father and older brothers listening to and analysing the dreams of all the children... When the Senoi child reports a falling dream, the adult answers with enthusiasm, "That is a wonderful dream, one of the best dreams a man can have. Where did you fall to, and what did you discover?"

The Senoi dream is meaningful, active, and creative. Adults deliberately go into their dreams to solve problems of interpersonal and intercultural conflict.

The ground was not dry and solid but damp and rather springy, product of the collaboration of living things and the long, elaborate death of leaves and trees; and from that rich graveyard grew ninety-foot trees, and tiny mushrooms that sprouted in circles half an inch across. The smell of the air was subtle, various, and sweet.

Bad as his dreams were, all terror and shame, yet he welcomed them. He had feared that he had gone too far into the dead land of action ever to find his way back to the springs of reality.

He had also come to like the Athsheans' names for their own lands and places, sonorous two-syllabled words: Sornol, Tuntar, Eshreth, Eshsen - that was now Centralville - Endtor, Abtan, and above all Athse, which meant the Forest, and the World. So earth, terra, tellus, meant both the soil and the planet, two meanings and one. But to the Athsheans soil, ground, earth was not that to which the dead return and by which the living live: the substance of their world was not earth, but forest. Terran man  was clay, red dust. Athshean man was branch and root. They did not carve figures of themselves in stone, only in wood.

For if it's all the rest of us who are killed by the suicide, it's himself whom the murderer kills; only he has to do it over, and over, and over.

"Sometimes a god comes," Selver said. "He brings a new way to do a thing, or a new things to be done. A new kind of singing, or a new kind of death. He brings this across the bridge between the dream-time and the world-time. When he has done this, it is done. You cannot take things that exist in the world and try to drive them back into the sream, to hold them inside the dream with walls and pretences. That is insanity. What is, is. There is no use pretending, now, that we do not know how to kill one another."
