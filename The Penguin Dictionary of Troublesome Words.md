For most of us the rules of English grammar are at best a dimly remembered thing. But even for those who make the rules, grammatical correctitudes sometimes prove easier to urge than to achieve.

Even now, many good writers scrupulously avoid hopefully and instead write the more cumbersome "it is hoped" to satisfy an obscure point of grammar, which, I suspect, many of them could not elucidate.

But at the same time, anything that helps bring order to a language as unruly and idiosyncratic as English is almost by definition a good thing. Even the most ardent structuralist would concede that there must be at least some conventions of usage. Otherwise we might as well spell fish (as George Bernard Shaw once wryly suggested) as ghoti: "gh" as in tough, "o" as in women, and "ti" as in motion. By the most modest extension it should be evident that clarity is better served if we agree to preserve a distinction between its and it's, between "I lay down the law" and "I lie down to sleep", between imply and infer, forego and forgo, flout and flaunt, anticipate and expect and countless others.

The purpose of this book is to try to provide a simple guide to the more perplexing or contentious issues of standard written English - or what the American authority John Simon, in an unguarded moment, called the normative grapholect. If you wish to say "between you and I" or use fulsome in the sense of lavish, you are entirely within your rights and can certainly find ample supporting precedents among many distinguished writers. But you may also find it useful to know that many such usages are at variance with that eccentric, ever-shifting corpus known as Good English.

No reader should ever be required to retrace his steps, however short the journey. (adjective pile up - Times headline "Police rape claim woman in court")

Ambivalent: ... Strictly speaking, it refers to a psychological state in which a person suffers from two irreconcilable desires.

Among (or amongst) applies to things that can be separated and counted, amid (or amidst) to things that cannot.

The belief that "and" should not be used to begin a sentence is without foundation. And that's all there is to it.

"Between you and I": John Simon calls this "a grammatical error of unsurpassable grossness." It is perhaps enough to say that it is very common and that it is always wrong. The rule is that the object of a preposition should always be in the accusative. More simply, we don't say "between you and I" for the same reason we don't say "give that book to I" or "as I was saying to she only yesterday."

Collectives: Deciding whether to treat nouns of multitude - words like majority, flock, army, Government, group, crowd - as singulars or plurals is entirely a matter of the sense you intend to convey. Although some authorities have tried to fix rules, such undertakings are almost inevitably, as Fowler says, wasted effort. On the whole, Americans lean to the singular and Britons to the plural, often in ways that would strike the other as absurd.

Diseases spread by contact are contagious. Those spread by air or water are infectious. Used figuratively ("contagious laughter", "infectious enthusiasm") either is all right.

It is perhaps a little fussy to insist too strenuously on the distinction, but, strictly, country refers to geographical characteristics of a place and nation to the political and social ones. Thus the United States is one of the richest nations, but largest countries.

Dangling modifiers are one of the more complicated and disagreeable aspects of English usage, but at least they provide some compensation by being frequently amusing.

Most often, dangling modifiers are cause by unattached present participles. But they can also invovle past and perfect participles, appositive phrases, clauses, infinitives, or simple adjectives. (strictly speaking, only adverb modify; nouns and adjectives qualify). Occasionally the element to be modified is missing altogether: "As reconstructed by the police, Pfeffer at first denied any knowledge of the Byrd murder" (cited by Bernstein). It was not, of course, Pfeffer that was reconstructed by the police, but the facts or story or some other noun that is only implied.

Many careful users of ENglish continue to insist that we treat data as a plural. To be sure, the purists have etymology on their side: in Latin, data is unquestionably a plural. The problem is that in English usage etymology doesn't always count for much. If it did, we could also have to write, "My stamina aren't what they used to be", or "I've just paid two insurance premia".
The fact is, of course, that for centuries we have been adapting Latin words to fit the needs and patterns of English. Museums, agendas, stadiums, premiums and many others are freely - and unexceptionally - inflected in ways that would have confounded Cicero. It may be time that we did the same for data.
#data 

Decimate: Literally, the word means to reduce by a tenth (from the ancient practice of punishing the mutinous or cowardly by killing every tenth man).

Deplore: You may deplore a thing, but not a person.

A prognosis is a projection of the course and likely outcome of a problem. Diagnosis applies only to conditions, not to people.

There is no difference in meaning between dialect and patois. Both describe the form of language prevailing in a region, though patois obviously is better reserved for context involving French or its variants. "He spoke in the patois of Yorkshire" is at best jocular. The plural of patois, incidentally, is patois.

Unlike dissociate and disassociate, which mean the same thing, dissemble and disassemble have quite separate meanings. Dissemble means to conceal. If someone close to you dies, you may dissemble your grief with a smile. Disassemble means to take apart.

A disinterested person is one who has no stake in the outcome of an event; an uninterested person is one who doesn't care.

Enthuse is a back formation - that is, a word coined from an existing word on the erronous assumption that the new word forms the root of the old word. At some point in the past, someone seeing the noun "enthusiasm" assumed, wrongly, that it was formed with a word "enthuse". There is nothing inherently wrong with back formations - scavenge, laze, grovel, and even pea (back formed from "pease") were all usefully added to the language as a consequence of ignorance. But many other back formations - among them commentate, sculpt, and emote - have failed to win complete acceptance because they are thought to be unnecessary or ungainly or to have too strong an air of novelty.

Fables and parables are both stories intended to have instructional value. They differ in that parables are always concerned with religious or ethical themes, while fables are usually concerned with more practical considerations (and usually have animals as the characters). An allegory is an extended metaphor - that is, a narrative in which the principal characters represent things that are not explicitly stated. Orwell's Animal Farm is an allegory. Myths originally were stories designed to explain some belief or phenomenon, usually through the exploits of superhuman beings. Today, of course, the word can signify any popular misconception or invented story.

Flak (often misspelled as "flack") is a contraction of the German Fliegerabwehrkanone ("anti-aircraft gun"), which contains nineteen letters, not one of them a "c".

It is an apparent inconsistency of English that "incombustible" describes an object that won't burn, while "inflammable" describes an object that will. Because the meaning of inflammable is so often misapprehended, there is an increasing tendency to use the less ambiguous flammable. In other cases this might be considered a regrettable concession to ignorance. But it would be even more regrettable to insist on linguistic purity at the expense of human safety.

In the increasingly unlikely event that you need to distinguish between these two, jetsam is that part of a shipwreck that has been thrown overboard (think of jettison) and flotsam that which has floated off of its own accord. Wreckage found on the sea floor is - or at least once wag - lagan. There was, of course, a time when the distinction was important: flotsam went to the crown and jetsam to the lord of the manor on whose land it was washed up.

A few purists continue to maintain that fraction in the sense of a small part is loose: 99/100 is also a fraction but hardly a negligible part. The looser usage,, however, has been with us for at least 300 years (Shakespeare employs it in Troilus and Cressida) and is unlikely the be misunderstood in most contexts. Even so, it would be more precise to say "a small part" or "a tiny part".

Gambit is often misused in either of two ways. First, it sometimes appears as "opening gambit", which is redundant. Second, it is often incorrectly employed to mean no more than ploy or opportunity or tactic. Properly, a gambit is an opening move that involves some strategic sacrifice or concession. All gambits are opening moves, but not all opening moves are gambits.

Gerunds are verbs made to function as nouns, as in "I don't like _dancing_" and "_Cooking_ is an art".

Economists on the whole have had about as much beneficial effect on our language as they have had on our economies. 

Hebrew/Yiddish. The two languages have nothing in common except that they are spoken primarily by Jewish people. Yiddish (from the German _judisch_ , "Jewish") is a modified German dialect and thus a part of the Indo-European family of languages. Hebrew is a Semitic tongue and therefore is more closely related to Arabic. Yiddish writers sometimes use the Hebrew alphabet, but the two languages are no more closely related than, say, English and Urdu.

There are two problems with hoi polloi. the first is that hoi polloi means the masses, the common populace and not the elite as is sometimes thought. The second problem is that in Greek hoi means "the", so to talk of "the hoi polloi" is tantamount to saying "the the masses". the answer to both problems is to avoid the expression altogether.

jargon, argot, lingua franca: At a conference of sociologists in American in 1977, love was defined as "the cognitive-affective state characterised by intrusive and obsessive fantastizing concerning the reciprocity of amorant feelings by the object of the amorance." That is jargon - the practice of never calling a spade a spade when you might as well call it a manual earth-restructuring implement. So long as it circulates only among a given profession, jargon is usually unobjectionable and frequently useful, since every profession needs its own form of shorthand. But all too often it escapes into the wider world.
Argot was originally eh language of thieves, but has, like jargon, come to mean a way of communicating peculiar to a particular group. Lingua franca (literally "the Frankish tongue") is any language or mixture of languages that serves as a common means of communicating among diverse parties. English, for instance, is the lingua franca of international air travel.

A lectern is the stand on which a speaker places his notes. A podium is the raised platform on which he and the lectern stand. A podium can only hold one person. A platform for several people is a dias. A rostrum is any platform; it may be designed for one speaker or for several.

The Oxford English Dictionary contains 414,825 words. Irregardless is not one of them.

What Samuel Johnson gave the world in lexicography, he sometimes took away in spelling. It is him we can thank for the fact that we have "deign" but "disdain", "moveable" but "immovable", and "deceit" but "receipt", among many others. With metal and mettle, however, his inconsistency of spelling was intentional.

Authorities have been trying to pin down the vagaries of shall and will since the seventeenth century, and most have some a cropper. In "The King's English", the Fowler brothers devote twenty pages to the distinctions. The gist of what they have to say is that either you understand the distinctions instinctively or you don't; that if you don't, you probably never will; and that if you do, you don't need to be told anyway.

To most people there are really only two things you can do with a target: you can hit it or you can miss it. But for journalists and politicians, targets are things to be achieved, attained, exceeded, expanded, reduced, obtained, met, beaten, overtaken and metaphorically shaken to bits. As a consequence their statements are often a little absurd and more than a little ambiguous.
