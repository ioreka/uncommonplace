If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to lead the sort of life he has imagined, assured Henry Thoreau, he will meet with success unexpected in common hours. "If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost. That is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them." #philosophy #quality-of-life #goals #dreams
