For most of us, our relationships with commodity culture is one of love/hate. Somewhere down the line, at one time or another, all of us are guilty of 'buying in', be it a car journey we don't need to make, a newspaper we simply must read or the cut-price supermarket beans which are just too, too cheap to be resisted. It's a tough one, but if we're truly going to beat the beast, it's one that we have to consider very seriously indeed. Regrettably, we can't have our cake and eat it. We need to create new modes of communication, new visions of change, new ways of breaking the impasse. In short, we need to create a new language. If we are to escape from the insanity of the New World Order and its globalised wonderland, we've got to reinvent ourselves in our own image. Only then will we be truly able to know what we mean and to mean what we say.

What the Wolverhampton conference proved to me was the wholly collusive nature of the relationship between corporate capitalism, politics, the media and academia. If history is to serve the interests of the dominant culture, in this case that of commodification, then its writers, most of whom inhabit the hallowed halls of Oxbridge, must toe the line, which isn't very difficult given that corporate capitalism finances most academic institutions. Is it any wonder, then, that what the media dismissively labelled as anarcho-punk, the politicians reviled as a threat to decent society, and the corporate capitalists saw as unprofitable filth should have been so diligently left out of the history books?

"No answer is in itself an answer" - Oriental proverb

"The anarchist revolution that we want transcends the interests of a single class; it envisages the liberation of all humanity which is at present enslaved, either economically, politically, or morally." - Errico Malatesta

The North American Indians regarded the land upon which they lived in much the same way that we regard the air we breathe, as something that could not be owned.

The lives of millions upon millions of people are run by a small handful of ruling elites who own all the wealth, all the land, and who have all the control. [...] They grow richer at our expense, but we are expected to look up to them as examples of success.

In the relatively short time that we have on this earth we probably have contact with thousands of people with whom we share little more than half-smiles and polite conversation. We are lucky if amongst those thousands of faces one actually responds to us with more than predictable formalities. Real friends are rare. True understanding between people is difficult to achieve, and when it is achieved it is the most precious of all human experiences.

From domestic violence to global war, the rules have always been the same, 'destroy that which you don't understand'. Pacifists and anarchists seek to creatively solve problems by developing mutual understanding between people rather than mutual hostility. Violence only makes disagreements worse. It works on the principle of winners and losers.

We have nothing but ourselves and each other.
