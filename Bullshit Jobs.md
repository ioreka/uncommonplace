Could there be anything more demoralizing than having to wake up every morning five out of seven days of one's adult life to perform a task that one secretly believed did not need to be performed - that was simply a waste of time or resources, of that even made the world worse? Would this not be a terrible psychic wound running across our society?

There can be no objective measure of social value.

As Socrates teaches us, when this happens - when our own definitions produce results that seem intuitively wrong to us - it's because we're not aware of what we really think. (Hence, he suggests that the true role of philosophers is to tell people what they already know but don't realize that they know. One could argue that anthropologists like myself do something similar.)

Bullshit jobs often pay quite well and tend to offer excellent working conditions. They're just pointless. Shit jobs are usually not at all bullshit; they typically involve work that needs to be done and is clearly of benefit to society; it's just that they workers who do them are paid and treated badly.

Shit jobs tend to be blue collar and paid by the hour, whereas bullshit jobs tend to be white collar and salaried.

These are two profoundly different forms of oppression.
