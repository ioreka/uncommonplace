Perhaps a city is a living thing. Each city has its own personality, after all. Los Angeles is not Vienna. London is not Moscow. Chicago is not Paris. Each city is a collection of lives and buildings and it has its own personality. So, if a has a personality, maybe it also has a soul. Maybe it dreams. I do not fear cities sleeping, stretched out unconscious around their rivers and estuaries, like cats in the moonlight. Sleeping cities are tame and harmless things. What I fear... is that one day the cities will waken. That one day the cities will rise. - Old man #cities #anthropomorphism #animism
