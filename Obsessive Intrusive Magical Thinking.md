I know this because I don't have a ragular brain at all, if a regular brain is a pink, fleshy mass making sensible decisions. Instead, in the cavern of my skull sits a Scalextric track. The electric car is loaded by an invisible force beyond my control with ideas, phrases and images, and without an exit ramp they swoop endlessly through the abyss in my head, an infinite figure-eight of looping thought patterns.

As a child, I didn't have any power to actually control the things that scared me, so I invented it. I used something that mental health experts call "magical thinking", the belief that unrelated events are causally connected and our thoughts can alter or influence their course. People with OCD often believe that arbitrary actions or thoughts can impact the things that we are afraid of.

OCD is personal: it feeds on whatever you are most afraid of; on your guilt, fear and sense of responsibility. It's born from a need to seek order in a world that doesn't have any.

Brighton winters were still bad but more bearable, in part because, by the sea, everything changes. At the end of the world, the sky does end, and the sea rises to meet it. You can see the seam of the grey blanket, where you could slip your fingers in and tear it away, bathing the city in light.

Still, something I know now that I didn't know at nine or fourteen or twnty is that my life has gotten better every single year. I am a year more recovered in my mental illness, a year more comfortable in my body, a year more knowledgeable, a year more aware of who i am, a yaer further from trauma. Every year brings new death and new comforts at once; I know this, yet I won't ever feel secure. I will always be old and young at once, to someone and to myself.

I have long felt trapped: by my family, by my mental health, by my body, by the restraints and corners of the city. Water is how I escape those constraints, whether its the weightlessness of a bath or a pool or the ocean.
#the-sea 

The ocean consumes the earth we live on, and yet we know as little about her as we do outer space, in parts. Assigning mythical qualities to the ocean, anthropomorphising her, is easy because it's hard to imagine that it really is just a bosy of water and salt. She is freedom! She has dark depths and unknowable monsters! She holds secrets and represents all the dimensions of knowledge we may never reach. How would she just be water, the same that sits in your dirty sink? I would still let her kill me before I would face a lifetime without knowing just a sliver of that freedom.

Autistic people enjoy things in a kind of all-consuming way that's hard to comprehend from the outside: we call them special interests, and they often sustain us in a cruel world.

It took me months to realise I couldn't keep living this way. I didn't want to die though, not really. I knew there were more beautiful things in the world than lying in my bed ignoring my friends, but I knew too that I had to go out and find them. 

Until then, I had struggled to reconcile my complicated past with having any kind of future, and it had taken everything in me just to not die. Being around that kind of warmth and vulnerability changed something in me. I had always loved so much: movies, bands, animals, Hello Kitty, Disneyland. But I had always been made to feel a little ashamed, like I should grow out of those things. In the months before my first trip to LA, I had unpicked that shame, learning that the only way to live was to let myself love fully.

People with a healthy relationship with death and mourning celebrate life and continue talking about people and keeping photos of them around the house. They avoid silence, celebrating death anniversaries as they did birthdays, making that person's brief time on this earth in ways that suit who they were in life. I have only every been taught to avoid death, to skirt around it, and then when it happens, to act surprised, somehow, as if we didn't know from birth that this was coming.

At eleven, I'm running when I feel a pain in my chest that means I need a bra. I put it off, so angry at this inconvenience, at this sudden maturity that I didn't ask for. I stare at myself in the mirror at a friend's house before we go swimming, seeing myself for the first time, the softness, the hair. It makes me feel sick: as if I am no longer myself, as is being a _young woman_ gives me more to worry about than the things I love, that I want to do. I walk around my village for a day with my hair shoved into a Batman cap, pretending to be a boy, hoping that's how I'm seen. I get my period at twelve and I cry, over and over again, refusing to speak to anyone about it. I feel at once so aware of my body and completely distant to it, as if I'm watching it change without my consent.

Most of us spend the first few years of our life believing in magic, until one day you are expected to accept that these things are pure fiction, that anyone who tells you otherwise is a lunatic.
#magic 

Believing in magic or in spirits or in elves is not widely accepted as something that grown, sensible adults do. But many, across the world, manage just that. It's hard ot imagine ever reading a headline crowing that "Many People in the US STILL Believe that a Man in the Sky Judges Everything They Do!". People find room to suspend disbelief for organised religion, but not for beliefs that have been around for many, many thousands of years.

Alice Tarbuck argues that there is no definitive proof that superstition doesn't work, which is kind of why OCD is so hard to shake - sometimes, however anecdotally, it does work.

I have always instinctively sought out spaces where the world is quiet, slipping into gaps where I might avoid being found. 

It doesn't take a lot to overwhelm me. I love people, I love the world, I love cities and wide-open spaces and restaurants and even aeroplanes in the right cirumstances. However, being autistic means that I am extremely sensitive to all of the things that come with those places - noises, smells, textures I can feel, hear and smell everything at once, and my brain is incapable of filtering out what it needs to hold onto. That sends me into overdrive, and after too long experienceing the world, I can have a meltdown.

I will always be overwhelmed, oversensitive, perpetually on the brink of some meltdown about something or other. My brain will always be relentless, but the one thingI have some control over (to some extent) is what those thoughts are, now. There is only so much room for so many thoughts, and I find that by focusing on my good obsessions, the intrusive thoughts get quieter. 

I like who I am now, but sometimes, when things are especailly noisy or my nightmares are bad and I feel like I'm getting no respite from the crueller thoughts, I wonder how I could live another ten, twenty, 30 years with this much chaos. I feel like I can't rest, can't get away from myself for even a second. Sometimes it gets to bad thatI genuinely want to die for just a little bit of silence. It's overwhelming, and combined with the overstimulation of the outside world and the pain I'm often in, it gets so much that I know know what I'll do if I have to spend the rest of my life living in this body.

The things that comfort me are the same things that did when I was a toddler, but now I have the autonomy to assert my need for them. People ask me sometimes why I sought diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder, the implication being that it's a bad thing - first of all, it's not. Second of all, the bad thing was living for most of my life without the language for what I felt, what I needed. I have less meltdowns now I understand why I have them to begin with. Diagnosis is a lifeline. It empowers me to live the way I need to, to ask for help and space.
