To a botanist, a herb (or herbaceous plant) is a non-woody plant that dies back to the ground at the end of the growing season, as opposed to a tree or shrub, which has one or more perennial, woody stems. An alternative definition of a herb, and one that is used in this book, is a plant which has leaves, flowers, seeds, fruits, shoots, sap, or roots - tasting or smelling sweet, bitter, aromatic, or pungent - that in limited quantity make food more flavoursome, aid human health, or produce pleasing fragrances. These useful plants make life better, healthier, or sweeter-smelling.

Egyptians planted the first herb gardens around 4,000 years ago.

Known for thousands of years, the elder is shrouded in folklore and superstition. Its common name stems from the Ango-Saxon word _aeld_ meaning "fire", and harks back to the ancient practice of using the tree's hollowed-out stems to blow on flames. 

Evergreen plants have long inspired and enchanted people, who collected their boughs and brought them into their homes as a decorative reminder that life still exists during the cold heart of winter. Holly and ivy, for example, were revered in pre-Christian Europe, and when Christmas began to be celebrated more widely, these plants were incorporated into this Christian festival by attaching religious significance to their leaves, red berries, and evergreen foliage.

"Where rosemary flourished, the woman ruled." Anon, cited in _A Modern Herbal_, Mrs M. Grieve, 1931

Although ancient civilisations were yet to discover the science behind their herbs, they did gravitate towards such useful plants. Rosemary was seen as a token of love and virility. The Greek goddess Aphrodite was said to have rosemary draped around her neck as she rose from the sea, and Roman brides carried a sprig in their bouquets or in crown garlands, signifying the grooms prowess. It was also believed to boost memory and became symbolic of remembrance.

Native to the Mediterranean, including parts of Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, rosemary takes its name from the Latin words _ros_ and _marinus_, meaning "dew of the sea" - referring to its perceived ability to thrive in dry, coastal areas by drawing water from moisture in the air.

By the Middle Ages, lavender was commonly used across Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia. During the Renaissance, it was used for protection against infections from cholera and the plague. It was used to treat early medical gloves and was a crucial component of the Four Thieves Oil - an essential oil concoction that is said to have prevented thieves from becoming infected while robbing the sick and dying during the plague.

How do antibacterial herbs work? Lavender, as with rosemary and thyme, has antibacterial properties. The key ingredients in lavender essential oil, such as linalool and linalyl acetate, inhibit the growth of certain bacteria and pathogens by destroying their membranes. This includes harmful food-borne bacteria like _E.coli_, which can cause severe stomach cramps and vomiting, and the skin-infecting _Staphylococcus aureus_.

As chilli powder inhibits mammals but not birds, it can be used to keep squirrels off bird feeders.

Chillies also have a long history of medicinal use and contain significant quantities of vitamin C - more than in citrus fruits. Chilli may reduce the risk of prostate and lung cancers; however high doses could increase the risk of gastric cancer and irritable bowel syndrome.

Capsaicin will dissolve in fats (lipophilic), and so milk is sometimes recommended to wash the faces of those affected by pepper spray.

Garlic has been utilized as a herb for much of human history. It was found among the treasures of Tutankhamun's tomb, dating back to 1325 BCE.

Garlic has also been found in Middle Eastern archaeological sites dating from as early as 3000 BCE and features in one of the world's oldest-known recipes: a Babylonian recipe for lamb stew.

Garlic plants produce bulbs as storage organs, allowing them to preserve food and nutrients that later fuel the production of flowers and seeds.

China is the biggest producer of garlic, harvesting 80% of the world's supply.

Allicin, the compound formed when garlic is crushed, breaks down in the stomach to produce allyl methyl sulphide, a potent scent that can last for several hours or even days. It produces distinctive halitosis and is also excreted through the skin and in urine. Mouthwash seldom relieves garlic breath, as allyl methyl sulphide is distributed in the bloodstream, allowing it to be expelled via the lungs. However, consuming foods such as milk, parsley, and peppermint can alleviate the symptoms. 

In Greek mythology, oregano is said to have been created by Aphrodite, who was believed to have grown the herb in her garden on Mount Olympus, as a symbol of happiness and joy for all around. This symbolism inspired the herb's use in wedding crowns.

Sage = emmenagogic = stimulates menstrual flow
Styptic = stops bleeding

Records of ginger's use as a healing herb date back more than 2000 years. Its known use stretches back some 5000 years, and it is thought to have featured in prehistoric cooking before being utilized for its medicinal properties.

Many of liquorice's medicinal benefits relate to its key active ingredient glycyrrhizin, a compound that is fifty times sweeter than sugar (sucrose).

Stinging nettles are the larval foodplant for many butterflies, including the Peacock, and moths, such as the Nettle-tap.

Parsley symbolized Persephone's associations with nature and the seasons but also with death; both ancient Greeks and Romans included it in their funeral rites.

First domesticated in China around 12,000 years ago, marijuana has one of the longest histories of human association of any plant. Its many uses include medicine, clothing, edible oil, and animal feed.

Marijuana is among the 6 per cent of flowering plants to be dioecious, having separate male and female plants.

Today, bracken is often regarded as a pernicious weed, but in the Middle Ages is was valued enough to be used as currency in rent disputes. The fern was gathered to make thatch for roofing, and it was also used as a packing material.

Spore capsules form on the folded-over edges of the underside of each segment (pinnule) of the bracken frond. A single frond may produce 300 million spores annually.
