The form of studying cerebral convolutions follows its contents; or in other words, despite (even because) they are virtually indistinguishable, the end of one field that studies convolutions is simply the beginning of another – just as with cerebral convolutions themselves

"Many people have a tree growing in their heads, but the brain itself is much more a grass than a tree. ‘The axon and the dendrite twist around each other like bindweed around brambles, with synapses at each of the thorns.’" (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 15)

"it is certainly now common knowledge that the brain, even although a physical organ, bears some intimate relation to the mind; and this knowledge is manifestly embodied in common idiom. When referring to admittedly mental happenings or conditions we speak of racking one’s brains, picking another’s brains, having it on the brain, having a good brain or, contrariwise, being all brawn and no brain; and so on." (Borst 1970: 13–14)

The brain itself has become a metaphor for mind. It is not yet possible to see the stuff that is called ‘mind’, but there are several ways in which the stuff of ‘brain’ can be seen – make the terms identical, and all of a sudden, mind can be seen. However, there is perhaps more seeing being done than understanding, as often ‘seeing’ is also idiomatically taken to mean ‘understanding’ when this is not necessarily the case.

"Like our visual system, we create meaning only through the differences we perceive and the boundaries we believe are present." (Otis 2000: 1–2)

Historians of science Fernando Vidal and Francisco Ortega have linked this reduction of the human subject to a ‘cerebral subject’ with the recent development of personhood into something more like ‘brainhood’

‘literature is a record of human consciousness, the richest and most comprehensive we have. Lyric poetry is arguably man’s most successful effort to describe qualia. The novel is arguably man’s most successful effort to describe the experience of individual human beings moving through space and time’ (Lodge 2002: 10)

‘such debates are most intense when one form of knowledge lays claim to the exclusive title to all knowledge. The contest is unnecessary. Literature constitutes a kind of knowledge about consciousness which is complementary to scientific knowledge’ (Lodge 2002)
#consciousness 

Instead of revolution, and as an antidote to just such neuro-revolutionary ennui (or its literary corollaries in the schisms of the neural and linguistic turns), I want to emphasize the idea of the convolution as a useful and invigorating way of reconceptualizing the interactions of literature and neuroscience – without at all bypassing the social institutions and practices in which both fields are irrevocably embedded

metaphor has been seen in recent times to largely govern our entire conceptualization of everyday life and its tasks

‘no literature without metaphor’ (Hickey and Reiss 2000: 101)
#creativity 

Literature and metaphor and the lifeworld are all related, but not in the ways that seem so intuitive in the first instance.

a strong metaphor suggesting metaphoric language as not just something produced by the gaze of science, but, going beyond its eye and on past the socket and into its brain, fundamental to the workings of its collective mind.

‘a mind is an instance of computation’ (2008 Edelman)

Bizarrely, however, although Tallis’s self-admission to failure – and admirable refusal to surrender nevertheless – is par for the course as far as the disavowal of scientific metaphoric strength is concerned, some branches of science, interestingly enough offshoots of linguistics and cognitive science, place metaphor at their centre. In fact, they do this in order to attempt to explain the pervasiveness of metaphor, which seems to be routinely passed over for inspection, as actually at the foundation of the way people think, let alone the way people speak or write.

"Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature" Lakoff and Johnson

in looking at language for their evidence for this, Lakoff and Johnson add another pre-determining layer of problematic circularity – the truth about the way people act and think can be seen in the way people use language, language itself determined by the way people think and act.

I identified Jorge Luis Borges as a writer who typifies my ideas on ‘convolutions’, where his fiction and the sciences of the mind and brain snake in and out of each other almost imperceptibly
#fantasy 

 Quian Quiroga elaborates: in my quest to understand different aspects of how the brain works […] it is rare, very rare, to come by a ‘Eureka.’ Problems are usually left open, answers usually lead to more questions, and the final solution is almost always elusive. But perhaps our obstinate perseverance may be nothing more than the knowledge that […] the pleasure is not in finding the answer but in searching for it. (2012: 3)
 #problemsolving #discovery #pursuit-of-knowledge 
 
 This pleasure, then, would be that of repetitive questioning and measuring, with its ultimate aim intentionally illusory; this feels like a paradoxical rationalization, a wilful equation of scientific method with the delusional quixotic quest. Unsurprisingly, this raises a further question – to what degree do scientists such as Quian Quiroga suffer from what philosopher of science Nicholas Maxwell somewhat problematically terms ‘rationalistic neurosis’?
 #science #madness
 
 In the quest for science, as in any interrogation of truth, it is better to choose to be rationalistically quixotic than to passively lapse into neurosis
 #truth 
 
 The true significance of a neurosis is teleological, […] the so-called traumatic experience is not an accident, but the opportunity for which the child has been patiently waiting – had it not occurred, it would have found another, equally trivial – in order to find a necessity and direction for its existence, in order that its life may become a serious matter. Of course it would be better if it could do without it, but unconsciously it knows that it is not, by itself, strong enough to learn to stand alone: a neurosis is a guardian angel; to become ill is to take vows. (Mendelson 1999: 99; also, Cf. W H Auden 2002: 112–113)
 #trauma #health 
 
 Auden claims the quest itself can inform a fruitful life, even if this makes it seem like one is willingly looking for aggravations and neuroses as a form of existential validation.
 
 "George Auden’s work as a doctor had made him consider not just the practice and history of medicine but also its philosophy. He liked to quote an aphorism that a doctor should ‘care more for the individual patient than for the special features of his disease,’ and he would tell Wystan: ‘Healing is not a science, but the intuitive art of wooing Nature.’" (H Carpenter 1983: 9)
 #care #healthcare #person-centered 
 
 Wystan’s avowed diagnostic knack for spotting psychosomatic illnesses, including in his own family, attests to the fact that for him the psychological and the physical were intimately linked, dovetailing with the abovementioned childhood fantasy amalgam of hard-edged, engineeringbased materialism, and a quixotic, idealized landscape. For Auden, what was in the head and what was in the world were no less real than each other.
 #holistic
 
 Auden became used to thinking about psychological models in relation to the customs and rituals of an entire society, rather than exclusively with reference to the personal history of the individual. […] He was notoriously fond of stressing the importance of neurosis in the formation of artistic personality, but perhaps the most significant emphasis he places in his statements on the uses of psychoanalysis is on the need to politicise it. (Mengham 2004: 165–166)
 #culture
 
 To be ‘mad in earnest’ can ease one’s suffering, and should therefore be one’s goal. This is because recalibrating madness or neurosis as having a ‘therapeutic function’ makes this goal clear and attainable to anyone capable of being selfreflective
 
 neurophenomenologist Dan Lloyd remarks, ‘Brains and stories do seem to have a powerful metaphorical connection. Both unfold worlds’ (Lloyd 2004: 332)

 Neuroscientists search for clues, follow the evidence and uncover things about ‘human nature’ that are most often hidden from view
 #discovery 
 
 What this slight distinction between definitions seems to suggest is nevertheless something that is common to both labyrinths and mazes: that they are both somehow physical and mental instantiations of perplexity at the same time, a meeting point of the literal and the figurative experience of confusion
 #labyrinths-and-mazes #quest
 
 David Willis McCullough: A labyrinth is a single circuitous path that leads uninterrupted to a centre, while a maze is a puzzle with many forks in the road that demand choices.
 
 ‘Science is a labyrinth built of questions, and a single researcher is able to creep down only a few passageways in his or her lifetime (and only a short distance in each one)’ (Davidson 2003: 87).
 
 This is undoubtedly a lot to cram into a brain – an entire world which includes that brain itself, in fact – and it is no wonder that if the brain is a maze, it is so because it is bewilderingly easy to get lost in the glut of supposed contents. Poundstone’s idea of a map to guide one through this all is therefore a seductive one. Indeed, mapping the labyrinth of the brain has been the logical conclusion of some, simply by positing thought itself as a map.
 
 To briefly recap, then, neuroscience convolves because its pursuit by sentient, culturally embedded human beings casts doubt on whether it is inside a labyrinth looking out, or outside looking in. Brain science, itself a labyrinth, has as its goal itself, which is why it constantly retains an air of mystery, or paradox; one that constantly demands but blocks investigation of itself.50 Similarly, it is fair to say that one cannot look directly at one’s own eyes; use of a mirror, or a photo, or someone else’s report is always distancing and thus always maintains a flavour of otherness
 
 Rather than look at one’s own unmediated brain directly – and for good reasons to do with the current physical impossibility of just such a scenario – it is the habit of the neuroscientist to disavow this end goal, and surrender to a more generalized purpose, that of the externalized labyrinth of other people’s brains, and the overall concept of ‘the brain’ in general. However, though this surface goal is less self-consciously complicated than the underlying goal of stable self-identity, the study of brains is still a vast and rocky terrain. This is why a map is so desirable. Hofstadter describes the objectivity of mapping as a way of masking the urge to avoid solipsistic discomfort: ‘How far back do we ordinarily trace the “I” in a sentence? The answer, it seems to me, is that we look for a sentient being to attach the authorship to. But what is a sentient being? Something onto which we can map ourselves comfortably’ (Hofstadter 2000: 608).
 
 Every neuron is a gun – it does not simply interact with its neighbour in a friendly manner, but instead fires at it. The idea of neurons ‘firing’ is so normal and idiomatic as to seem entirely natural and unquestionable. But by the extension of this logic, every brain module or neural assemblage is a tactical unit and every brain is an arsenal or perhaps a missile silo. At the neuronal level, whose finger is on the trigger? And at the brain level, whose finger hovers above the red button? In either case, the major issue is speed: be quick or be dead, an arms race of sorts. The action of neurons firing, constitutive of cerebral processes which in turn constitute one’s self, happens much more quickly than that self is capable of assimilating, or cognizing. A single neuron has no intelligible agency of its own, meaning it does not fire itself – so it is more proper to say that neurons are fired, not that they fire. However, if this is the case, and yet it still happens too fast for one to be aware of in oneself, who is it that is doing the firing? One answer is the totality of other neurons that together contribute to the firing of each single neuron; but of course this simply defers the issue backwards indefinitely, with no originary moment of firing to speak of – all of this in a fraction of a second, unnoticeable and fundamentally incomprehensible to the human consciousness which somehow arises from the whole neuronal volley of shots.
 
 This difference between what can legitimately happen in literature and what can happen in so-called ‘real life’ is crucial but nuanced. It is reminiscent of Derrida’s assertion that 'experience of Being, nothing less, nothing more, on the edge of metaphysics, literature perhaps stands on the edge of everything, almost beyond everything, including itself. It’s the most interesting thing in the world, maybe more interesting than the world, and this is why, if it has no definition, what is heralded and refused under the name of literature cannot be identified with any other discourse. It will never be scientific, philosophical, conversational.' (Derrida 1992: 47)
 
 However, as he goes on to say, if it did not open onto any of those discourses, it would not be literature either. There is no literature without a suspended relation to meaning and reference. Suspended means suspense, but also dependence, condition, conditionality. In its suspended condition, literature can only exceed itself. No doubt all language refers to something other than itself or to language as something other. (Derrida 1992: 48; original emphasis)
 
  literature, at least since neurology’s heyday in the nineteenth century, has contaminated or seeped over into all the other discourses it has touched (and vice versa)
  
  As with literature, the brain is somehow in the world just as it contains the world, an unavoidable presumption of ‘presence’ which nevertheless ‘blossoms out of absence’
