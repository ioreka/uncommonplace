If some day we build mahcine brains that surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new super intelligence could become very powerful. And, as the fate of gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species would depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence.

Especially after the adoption of agriculture, population densities rose along with the total size of the human population. More people meant more ideas; greater densities meant that ideas could spread more readily and that some individuals could devote themselves to developing specialized skills.

A few hundred thousand years ago, in early human (or hominin) prehistory, growth was so slow that it took on the order of one million years for human productive capacity to increase sufficiently to sustain an additional one million individuals living at subsistence livel. By 5000 BC, following the Agricultural Revolution, the rate of growth had increased to the point where the same amount of growth took just two centuries. Today, following the Industrial Revolution, the world economy grows on average by that amount every ninety minutes.

Two decades is a sweet spot for prognosticators of radical change: near enough to be attention-grabbing and relevant, yet far enough to make it possible to suppose that a string of breakthroughs, currently only vaguely imaginable, might by then have occurred. Contrast this with shorter timescales: most technologies that will have a big impact on the world in five or ten years from now are already in limited use, which technologies that will reshape the world in less than fifteen years probaby exist as laboratory prototypes. Twenty years may also be close to the typical duration of a forecaster's career, bounding the reputational risk of a bold prediction.

Let us note at the outset that however many stops there are between here and human-level machine intelligence, the latter is not the final destination. The next stop, just a short distance farther along the tracks, is superhuman-level machine intelligence. The train might not pause or even decelerate at Humanville Station. It is likely to swooch right by. #humans-and-machines 

We know that blind evolutionary processes can product human-level intelligence, since they have already done so at least once. 

Different people working toward machine intelligence hold different views about how promising neuromorphic approaches are compared with approaches that aim for completely synthetic designs. The existence of birds demonstrated that heavier-than-air flight was physically possible and prompted efforts to build flying machines. Yet the first functioning airplanes did not flap their wings. The jury is out on whether machine intelligence will be like flight, which humans achieved through an artificial mechanism, or like combustion, which we initially mastered by copying naturally occurring fires. #artificial-intelligence 

In other words, assuming that the observable universe is void of extraterrestrial civilizations, then what hangs in the balance is 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 human lives (though the true number is probably larger). If we represent all the happiness experienced during one entire such life with a single teardrop of joy, then the happiness of these souls could fill and refill the Earth's oceans ever second, and keep doing so for a hundred billion billion millennia. It is really important that we make sure these truly are tears of joy. #consequences 

We consider four types of "castes" - oracles, genies, sovereigns, and tools.

Against a backdrop of perplexity and uncertainty, analysis stands out as being of particularly high expected value. Illumination of our strategic situation would help us target subsequent interventions more effectively. Strategic analysis is especially needful when we are radically uncertain not just about some detail of some peripheral matter but about the cardinal qualities of the central things. #strategy 

What we mean by "strategic analysis" here is a search for crucial considerations: ideas or arguments with the potential to change our views not merely about the fine-structure of implementation but about the general topology of desirability.

Another high-value activity, one that shares with strategic analysis the robustness of property being beneficial across a wide range of scenarios, is the development of a well-constituted support base that takes the future seriously. Such a base can immediately provide resources for research and analysis. If and when other priorities become visible, resources can be redirected accordingly. A support base is thus a general-purpose capability whose use can be guided by new insights as they emerge. #planning

Another dimension of social epistemology is the management of sensitive information, in particular information that ought to be kept secret. (Information continence may be especially challenging for academic researchers, accustomed as they are to constantly disseminating their results on every available lampost and tree.)

Before the prospect of an intelligence explosion, we humans are like small children playing before a bomb. Such is the mismatch between the power of our plaything and the immaturity of our conduct. Superintelligence is a power for which we are not ready now and will not be ready for a long time. We have little idea when the detonation will occur, though if we hold the devide to our ear we can hear a faint ticking sound.

Eliezer Yudkowsky has been particualrly emphatic in condemning thiskind of misconception: our intuitive concepts of "smart" and "stupid" are distilled from our experience of variation over the range of human thinkers, yet the differences in cognitive ability within this human cluster are trivial in comparison to the differences between any human intellect and a superintelligence. #relativity #intelligence
