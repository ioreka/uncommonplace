Much like Warley, Tresserve was on a steep hill. A true gardener's gardener, one of Elle's first improvements was installing an irrigation system, unglamorous but essential, as was a heated greenhouse against the region's frozen winters.

A daffodil bulb was an investment. It was not just an object of reverence in itself, of even a promise of immense, rare beauty, the horticultural equivalent of an Old Master. Bulked-up, it had commercial potential, especially in the bull market of the 1980s, but it was also a risk. Bulbs could desiccate, rot, become battered by storms, eaten by pests or, on occasion, turn out not to be the prized variety at all, substituted for a regular, run of the mill daff, either by accident or by downright chicanery.

Many Victorian women enjoyed deep friendships that, on paper, can come across to today's eyes, searching for sexual connotations, as more than they are. This is further complicated by the fact that modern ideas of homosexuality are exactly that - modern constructs. History has seen many degrees of love, some of which, though occasionally physical, may still have been somewhere in between heterosexuality and homosexuality, and the 1890s was a time of sexual flux.

Ellen Willmott was brought up to be a plant lover above all other aspects of gardening; if we keep the art analogy, she was more interested in the paint than the picture. Her gardening was heavily directed towards grouping plants with others that requires similar conditions or came from the same geographical region than creating something 'artistic' with colour, structure and pattern. I have often heard people say she collected plants for their curiosity, rarity and, frankly their cussedness in growing requirements than for what they actually looked like. Some of her rarest plants aren't very exciting to look at but present the ultimate gardener's challenge: getting them to grow at all.

Everyone has some kind of passion. Most of us pick an interest or two then stick to them. Then there are the polymaths: the 'renaissance folk' that see no problem in concurrently following a ridiculous range of diverse, disparate interests, equally brilliantly, all at the same time.

Every book is perfect before an author puts pen to paper. To witness it emerge from one's fingers as a shadow of the imagined paragon is the heartbreak of being a writer.

To this day every specimen of _Ceratostigma willmottianum_ grown in Britain can trace its roots back to two seedlings: one at Warley; one Ellen sent to Rose at Spetchley Park.

Undiluted charisma is not always appreciated.

They say it takes a village to raise a child but literary babies sometimes need a town. Or even a city. The sheer number of people who have bent over backwards to help me on this extraordinary journey of discovery is both impressive and humbling in that they were so willing - and keen - to help me achieve a dream. If there are mistakes or misconceptions within these pages, the fault will entirely be my own.
