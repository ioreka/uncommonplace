Nothing makes us more vulnerable than when we love someone. We can be hurt very easily. But I've always believed that what you get when you love someone is greater than what you risk. - Chakotay

But maybe, just maybe, Benny isn't the dream. We are. Maybe we're nothing more than figments of his imagination. For all we know, at this very moment, somewhere, far beyond all those distant stars, Benny Russell... is dreaming of us. - Sisko

That might be the most important thing to understand about Humans. It's the unknown that defines our existence. We are constantly searching, not just for answers to our questions, but for new questions. - Sisko

I want to live, however briefly, knowing that my life is finite. Mortality gives meaning to human life. Peace, love, friendship. These are precious because we know they cannot endure. A butterfly that lives forever is really not a butterfly at all. - Data

I never knew what a friend was until I met Geordi. He spoke to me as though I were human. He treated me no differently from anyone else. He accepted me for what I am. And that, I have learned, is friendship. But I do not know how to say goodbye. - Data

It is the struggle itself that is most important. We must strive to be more than we are. It does not matter that we will never reach our ultimate goal. The effort yields its own rewards. - Data

I would gladly risk feeling bad at times, if it also meant that I could taste my dessert. - Data

Without the darkness, how would we recognize the light? Do not fear your negative thoughts. They are part of you. They are a part of every living being - even Vulcans. - Tuvok #darkness #emotion 

Commander, I don't think you can analyze love. It's the greatest mystery of all. No one knows why it happens, or doesn't. Love is a chance combination of elements. Any one thing might be enough to keep it from igniting - a mood, a glance... a remark. And if we could define love, predict it - it would probably lose its power. - Neelix #love 

Three books and ten reports is impressive, but quantity is less relevant than quality. You must be able to interpret the data and enjoy the process. Regardless, you require activities other than assimilating books and reports. A game of Kadis-kot, for example. - Seven of Nine #pursuit-of-knowledge #data #reading 

It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life. Captain Picard #losing #mistakes

Words define who we are. Officer. Orphan. Widower. Shipmate. But there is no word for the unique agony of uncertainty. Michael Burnham #loss  #grief #uncertainty #friendship #meaningfulness #language 

Most people will never get a chance to learn what's in their own hearts. If we figure it out, it's often not what we expected, or even what we would have chosen for ourselves. Pike #growth #self #choice

What I feel for you belongs to you alone. Michael Burnham #love

"In a very real sense, we are all aliens on a strange planet. We spend most of our lives trying to reach out and communicate. If during our lifetime we could reach out and really communicate with just two people, we are indeed very fortunate." Gene Roddenberry #friendship #communication 

"It is the struggle itself that is most important. We must strive to be more than we are. It does not matter that we will not reach our ultimate goal. The effort itself yields its own reward." Gene Roddenberry #growth 

In times of crisis, people need to know that their leaders are not rattled by uncertainty or overwhelming odds. They need to know that there is a plan, that they'll be okay. Michael Burnham #leadership #uncertainty 

Love always ends in grief, but we can't let the pain do this to us. Book #love #grief 

I have come to believe the limits that I place upon myself do not protect me so much as dull the brightness of my days. Saru #growth #exploration
