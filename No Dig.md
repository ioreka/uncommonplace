As above, so below: there is a cosmos out of sight beneath our feet. If only it were visible, we would be amazed at the life and activity within the soil, and scientific research is allowing us to increase our knowledge of soil organisms, their interactions with plants, and their impact on soil health. No dig allows this soil ecosystem to develop undisturbed and every year I'm delighted by the growth in my garden, which occurs simply as a result of enabling natural processes.

Compost refers to any carbon-based material that is well decomposed.

Compost is not fertilizer and is not used to feed plants directly. When laid on top of beds it feeds the diverse life within the soil, which in turn produces complex organic compounds containing nutrients that plant roots can access whenever they need them, with help from the mycelial network of mycorrhizal fungi. This natural process, which is enabled through no dig, allows us to trust the soil to feed plants whenever they need it without any extra iniput. The complex carbon-based molecules containing nutrients are not water soluble and therefore do not leach away with rainfall or watering, unlike the nutrients in synthetic fertilizers, which need constant management.

The idea of succession is that you keep your ground planted all the time, at least until winter. Soild doesn't need a rest and is, in fact, healthier with plants rooting into it. With your beds filled in this way, no sunlight is waster because there are always leaves converting solar energy into organic carbon, which plants make available to the soil food web.

Before starting, be clear what you hope yo harvest from each planting: do you want to grow large lettuce heads that need lots of room to develop, or plants to pick for outer leaves that stay more compact? General advice on seed packets doesn't always explain these differences, or that you can use spacing to influence the. size of vegetables, for example by planting closer together for more small onions, or further apart for fewer larger ones.

Soil moisture affects both flavour and yield, because lower moisture levels limit growth which increasing sweetness in fruiting crops, such as tomatoes and sweet peppers, and root crops, like carrots and beetroot.

Winter conditions affect flavour in a different way, because plants defend themselves by converting starches in their leaves and roots into sugars. These act as antifreeze in plant tissues and they make Brussels sprouts, kale, and cabbages sweeter after frost, along with overwintering roots such as parsnips and swedes.
