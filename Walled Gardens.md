Walk into a vibrant and hard-working kitchen garden today and you'll be overwhelmed by the riot of colour and product that stretches in every direction. Order and functionality underwrite this picutre of beds and borders bursting with life - and yes, for all that sense of industry, they have always struck me as places that wrap you up in a comforting sense of calm. The door that separates the outside world from the one within is a complex, almost magical threshold. In crossing it you step into a place of enchantment, an escape from all that is burdensome about the world outside.

From their inception walled gardens were a wholly practical addition, relied upon to produce enough fruit and vegetables to support large or small households throughout the year. They were, in effect, the private supermarkets of those who built and worked them: a vital food source epected to repay the investment required to build them. Over a period of 400 years the biggest and wealthiest estates took the simple concept of a walled kitchen garden and transformed it, both in size and capability. Among wealthy owners the ambition to out-produce their rivals established a horticultural arms race. This culminated in the great walled kitchen gardens of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which championed the art, craft and science of gardening.

However, size is only one indicator of a garden's value, and the wealth of those who built it. Irrespective of how many acres it covered, the principle of growing produce all year round within the unique environment created by the garden's walls was common to all.

The ambition of the walled gardener was to build both efficiently and effectively, but rarely, it appears, cheaply.

If our fantasy garden did exist, some might say there would be no need to visit any other, and that would be a tragedy. For in visiting the gardens that follow I have discovered an immersive, addictive blend of architectural, horticultural and social history. Walled gardens are all the richer because they are so individually distinct and all, when you know what to look for, have a fascinating story to reveal.

By the close of the century, the British walled kitchen garden had developed into pershaps the finest of its kind in the world. Yet for all the science and technology that such gardens now displayed, success depended upon an essential component that only experience could provide: the tried and tested skills, intuition and discipline of their gardeners.

Repton, famously described as the last great landscape architect of the eighteenth century. I  1791 Repton, then at the start of his landscaping careeer, produced one of his earliest "Red Books" for Tatton. This beautifully bound volume is packed full of exquisite plans, sketches, watercolours and innovative overlays, providing his clients with a unique "before and after" insight into his vision for the estate.

In 1922 Winston Churchill, then 48 and a seasoned political figure, bought a modest 80-acre estate in Kent. Chartwell would remain his home for the next 43 years until his death in 1965 at the age of 91. During that time he extended and remodelled both house and grounds, immersing himself in a creative project that sustained him through the most challenging periods of his life. 

The walled garden at Chartwell is typical of many added to estates. It was not started until 1925, and is significant not for its size or complexity, but because it was built when many kitchen gardens were struggling to survive. In addition, it was not only designed by Churchill, but built with his own hands. To my knowledge, no other walled kitchen garden was so authored by its original owner. This alone would make it unique among walled gardens, but Churchill imbued it with a distinction few others have ever possessed. His kitchen garden was designed to be productive, but also to be a family space in which they could entertain, hidden from the world beyond its walls.

All these observations to me describe a man who simply loved having a go, regardless of expertise. His fascination with detail and process, revealed through his life and office as a war leader, are perfectly in tune with his practical intuitions. Churchill never saught to excuse his failings, and while his handiwork reveals much about his limitations as a builder, it also portrays an undaunted gardener, designer and family man. For someone of his character, the process of creating a home through blood, sweat and tears was the motivation for buying it in the first place. 

Of the many additions made during Chirchill's time at Chartwell, most are imbued with a sense of family life and fun. The Marycot, Churchill's studio, the swimming pool, butterful house, croquet lawn and fish ponds combine to create a garden for the enjoyment of family and friends.

Chartwell's walled garden is a simple creation that both champions imperfection and celebrates the ambition of its builder. 

The story of Britain's classic walled gardens spans at least four centuries. In their own way, each century has created a horticultural climate that influenced that gardens' development.
