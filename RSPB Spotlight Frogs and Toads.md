The odds of survival for most tadpoles are very low in most cases. For instance, there may be as many as 1000 eggs in a blog of frogspawn laid by the Common Frog (Rana temporaria), of which perhaps only 50 tadpoles make it to metamorphosis and just two or three frogs reach reproductive age two or three years later. Every adult anuran alive today is a representative of fortune, therefore, a lucky one or two in a thousand.

Not all frogs and toads let the universe decide their fate in such a way; is seems that some anurans make their own luck.

Common frogs are nothing if not tenacious. It is incredible to consider that every individual in mainland Britain is the descendent of a few pioneering frogs that crossed the land bridge from Europe after the last Ice Age 10,000 years ago. 

I suspect that most members of the general public consider one frog to be very much like another. But Pool Frogs are different to Common Frogs in many ways, so it is a great thing to be able to consider them true British residents, resurrected.

The scale of the 20th-century decline of Natterjack Toads is nothing short of jaw-dropping and speaks volumes about the dramatic loss of the dry, sandy heathlands with which they associate. It is estimated that only one-sixth of the heathland in the UK that existed 200 years ago remains today, with the surviving patches facing a suite of pressures, including air pollution, recreational disturbance and human-caused heathland fires.

The large population of frogs that now exists in Romney Marsh originated from just 12 frogs introduced from Hungary in 1935. 

Most adult frogs and toads are graduates of that most dangerous area of allL the pond. These water bodies abound in tadpole-eating predators, including fish, Greater Water Boatmen (Notonecta glauca), Water scorpions (Nepa cinerea), newts, and the carnivorous larvae of dragonflies, damselflies, mayflies, and particularly, water beetles. The stakes are heavily weighted against frogs and toads in this, their early life stage. In some years, only a handful will ever make it to metamorphosis. 

A well-worn estimate for British frogs and toads is that just 1-5% of tadpoles will make it out of the pond as metamorphs, and of these, only 1-5% will make it to breeding age at two of three years. In other words, for every adult frog or toad that you see, there were perhaps a thousand tadpoles that didn't make it. But even as adults, the chances of survival each year are skewed towards ill fortune. In the UK, it is estimated that, for every year of life on land, 50% of adult frogs and toads won't make it back to the pond the following year to breed. Based on numbers like these, it is a lucky frog indeed that will live to five or six years, and a luckier frog still that lives to see a decade.

Research has shown that in milder winters hibernating toads burn up more calories than in colder, longer winters, emerging in spring with fewer fat reserves. If sustained mild winters become a phenomenon in the UK and Europe, it is unclear what impact this may have on breeding populations of toads. In some cases, this lack of adequate dormancy may be yet another stress contributing to local population declines.

Being highly porous, frog skin offers more than just protection from the elements. Interestingly, it can act as a boundary through which gases can pass - in effect, acting like a lung. Male Common Frogs make full use of this feature, choosing to lie submerged in ponds during the winter months.

What we see in their reproductive behaviours at this time of year is a hidden world of politics, rage, lust and corruption; a place of intense energetic interchange and high-stakes gambling; a world that rings with a patterned chorus to those who listen and a cacophony to those who don't.

Far from being mindless biological automatons, frogs and toads are clearly highly sensitive to a range of cues that lead them to potential breeding sites. And with 150 million years of evolution on their side, what else should we expect?

An even more pervasive threat (than non-native species or disease) is habitat loss. The lack of clean, accessible fresh water alongside the terrestrial habitats frogs and toad depend on is perhaps the greatest danger facing many amphibian populations. However, this can bring us some hope. If we manage our freshwater and terrestrial habitats better, amphibians will flourish and so will we. Just like them, we depend on the same life blood: clean water. We are different to amphibians, but only by a degree.

Perhaps more than any other group of animals on earth, frogs and toads have enthralled, entertained and inspired human cultures for centuries, particularly through stories and songs. But it wasn't always this way, for frogs and toads have been on a cultural journey that has seen them go from saviour to supernatural, and from seance to science. In the modern age, the relationship we have with amphibians is ever changing.

To every generation, all over the world, it appears frogs and toads are capable of meaning something different.
