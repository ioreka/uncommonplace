"If I leave you in ignorance, I’ll be to blame if you get yourself killed there."

‘There is a secret you must learn, child,’ Jasnah said. ‘A secret that is even more important than those relating to Shadesmar and spren. Power is an illusion of perception.’
‘Don’t mistake me,’ Jasnah continued. ‘Some kinds of power are real – power to command armies, power to Soulcast. These come into play far less often than you would think. On an individual basis, in most interactions, this thing we call power – authority – exists only as it is perceived.

‘Natural laws?’ Syl said, finding the concept amusing. ‘Laws are of men, Kaladin. Nature doesn’t have them!’

Remembering the fallen was important, but working to protect the living was more so.
#life-and-death 

Such delightful inventions, spectacles. To live was to be a fragment of the cosmere that was experiencing itself. How could he properly experience if he couldn’t see?

‘Perspective,’ Ym said, holding up his hand and wiggling his fingers. ‘From very close up, the fingers on a hand might seem individual and alone. Indeed, the thumb might think it has very little in common with the pinky. But with proper perspective, it is realized that the fingers are part of something much larger. That, indeed, they are One.’

Progress is learning to control your world.

‘I shouldn’t have asked,’ Shallan said. ‘I already know the answer, and it is a very human one. These people seek to control the knowledge so that they can profit from it. Profit from the apocalypse itself.'

Using a fetching face to make men do as you wish is no different from a man using muscle to force a woman to his will, she’d said. Both are base, and both will fail a person as they age.

"almost is a big distinction in assassinations."

you could not have a traitor who had not originally been a friend.

This was the mark of humankind: to take the wild, unorganized world and make something logical of it. You could get so much more done when everything was in its place, when you could easily find what or whom you needed. Creativity required such things. Careful planning was, indeed, the water that nourished innovation.

‘I like to learn to use the local weapons,’ Mraize said. ‘It is a quirk, though I feel it is justified. If you want to understand a people, learn their weapons. The way men kill one another says far more about a culture than any scholar’s ethnography.’

You fear nonexistence, but is not unconsciousness the same thing?

I say that there is no role for women – there is, instead, a role for each woman, and she must make it for herself. For some, it will be the role of scholar; for others, it will be the role of wife. For others, it will be both. For yet others, it will be neither.

Unlike a sword, scorn has only the bite you give it.

The wisest of men know that to render an insult powerless, you often need only to embrace it.

To be human was often to be forced to choose between distasteful options.

To age truly was to suffer the ultimate treason, that of one’s body against oneself.

‘On both my most stupid days and my most incredible,’ Taravangian said, ‘I am unable to interact with those around me in a meaningful way. It is like . . . like I become a gear that cannot fit those turning beside it. Too small or too large, it does not matter. The clock will not work.’

Jasnah had once defined a fool as a person who ignored information because it disagreed with desired results.

Contradictions. Those were what made people real.

terrified, yet also brave, for one allowed the other to exist.
#bravery 

Break a rock, and it’s still there. Break a spren, and she’s still there. Sort of. Break a person, and something leaves. Something changes. What’s left is just meat. You’re weird.’
