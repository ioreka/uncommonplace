Modern medical science creates new moral choices, and challenges traditional views that we have of ourself.

Medical ethics ranges from the metaphysical to the mundanely practical. It is concerned not only with these large issues but also with everyday medical practice. Doctors get caught up in people's lives, and ordinary life is full of ethical tensions.

As Auden's Old Masters knew, the ordinary is what is important to most of us, most of the time.

In pursuing medical ethics we must be prepared to grapple with theory, allowing time for speculation and the use of the imagination. But we must also be ready to be practical: able to adopt a no-nonsense, down-to-earth, approach.
#theory-vs-practice #imagination 

I believe that medical ethics is essentially a rational subject; that is, it is all about giving reasons for the view that you take, and being prepared to change your views on the basis of reasons.

We need to develop our hearts as well as our minds. Consistency and moral enthusiasm can lead to bad acts and wrong decisions if pursued without the right sensitivities.

It is the hard of dying that makes killing a wrong and not the other way around.

When suffering is the result of following a moral principle then we need to look very carefully at whether we are applying it too inflexibly.

Medical practice should be continually improving through subjecting itself to the scrutiny of those twin disciplines, science and philosophy. Science asks: What is the evidence that this is the best treatment? How good is the evidence? What evidence is there for alternative treatments? Philosophy demands reasons for the moral choices made: Is it right to help this single woman conceive a child using methods of assisted reproduction? Should all attempts be made to prolong the life of this patient using the facilities of intensive care, or should she be allowed to die but in as little distress as possible?

Everyone expects philosophical reasoning to be rigirous, to be logically valid. But what makes philosophy in general, and ethics in particular, so exciting is that providing reasons, and giving arguments, requires not only intellectual rigour but also imagination. Ethics uses many tools of reasoing, but it is not just a question of learning how to use the tools: there is always the possibility of a leap of the imagination - of a different perspective or an interesting comparison that puts the whole question in a new light and takes our thinking forward.

Logicians like to spot, and name, fallacious arguments, rather as ornithologists spot birds.
#classification

It is a long-established liberal principle that a person who suffers from a mental illness may be found 'not guilty', even though he committed a criminal act, on the grounds that he should not be held responsible for his behaviour, because of the illness. Crudely put: the person's body committed the act, but the person's mind did not commit the crime. 
#cartesian-duality #consequences 

A criminal who has served his sentence must be released from prison even if he remains dangerous. A mentally disordered patience who remains dangerous may be kept locked up forever. Is this fair?
#justice 

What seems unacceptable to me is to bypass this issue altogether and to treat all those with a mental disorder paternalistically, while allowing those without mental disorder the freedom to refuse treatment. To do so is to discriminate, once again, against those suffering from a mental illness.

Tomorrow's medicine is today's research. That is why the question of how we allocate resources to research is at least as important as the question of how we allocate resources to health care itself.
