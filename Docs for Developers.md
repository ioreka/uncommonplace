 The most successful projects have documentation to guide developers through each of these steps. It’s because documentation is a feature. In fact, it’s the first feature of your project most users interact with, because it’s the first thing we look for when trying to solve a problem.
 #documentation #product #user-experience 
 
 The writer loop is similar to how we write code. It requires you to understand the problem your users are trying to solve, create a plan for solving it, use common design patterns, and write the content that solves the issue. The developer loop and the writer loop are two sides of the same coin. During the writing loop, we’re creating information our users want during the developer loop. Knowing how to bring these two loops into alignment helps both your project and your users succeed.
 #patterns #pursuit-of-knowledge 
 
 You have about five minutes to help developers find the information they need before they abandon your project and move on to something else.
 #prioritisation 
 
 You might have heard the often-misquoted saying that good code documents itself. It’s true that good naming, types, design, and patterns make code easier to understand. But projects with sufficient complexity and scale (that is, most projects worth building) need human-readable documentation to help others quickly understand what you’re building and how to use it.
 #idioms #complexity 
 
 "[X product] is so easy for me to use, I didn’t think about how hard it might be for others"
 #perspective #empathy 
 
 In the late 1980s, a group of economists at Harvard determined that humans assume others have the same knowledge they do. They named this cognitive bias the “curse of knowledge.”
 #bias #knowledge 
 
 Consider: why are you writing this documentation in the first place? You don’t just want your users to know something about your software; you want them to complete a set of tasks or change their behavior in some way. There is an engineering goal (for them) and a business goal (for you) that you want your users to reach.
 
 Some questions, in general, apply to all products. Questions like: • What is this product? • Will this product solve my problem? • What features are available? • How much does it cost? • How do I get started? Other questions are going to be very specific to your product, your users, and their goal: • How do I authenticate against your API? • How do I use a specific feature? • How do I troubleshoot a specific problem?
 
 Even the most perfectly designed questions are only useful if people answer them.

A user journey map is a diagram showing the path a user takes through a product or website while trying to accomplish a particular task. The map usually covers all routes or “channels” a user may take when interacting with your software and documentation.

A friction log is a journal in which you try your software as a user would and record your experiences. To record your experience, log each step sequentially, noting the behavior you expect and the actual behavior of your software. The bigger the gap between expectation and reality, the bigger the opportunity to improve your docs or software.

Comments help you reorient to your own code.

Guiding users through first impressions and first-time user experience is the critical role of getting started documentation. Getting started docs are your opportunity to help users get up and running and to build trust with your users that you will guide and support them with good resources.
#mental-models #support

Getting started documentation should translate your user’s interest into them actually developing with your product.

Limit the number of concepts explained in a single document. Readers are generally good at absorbing one core concept at a time.

A procedural document shows readers how to accomplish a specific goal by following a set of structured steps. A single step should describe a single action that a user takes.
#learning #teaching

People read documentation to solve a problem or accomplish a task, and they want to do so as quickly and effectively as possible.
#problemsolving 

If your tutorial includes more than ten steps, you’re trying to solve for a use case that’s too complex, or you’re combining too many actions in one document. Long, time-consuming tutorials make it less likely that a user will successfully finish. If you can’t condense a long tutorial—or any procedural content, for that matter—into fewer steps despite your best efforts, it could mean the service itself is too complex. There may be steps that should be combined, automated, or omitted from the service—and that’s a conversation you should have with the product developers.
#product #feedback #cybernetics #knowledge #communication #sapir-whorf #linguistic-relativity #growth 

Complex documentation helps you identify potential user challenges and can be an opportunity to improve the service itself.
#challenge #continuous-improvement 

Prerequisites not only tell users what they need to accomplish a goal; they also provide users with an escape hatch. Escape hatches are helpful cues that signal to a user that they’re probably not in the right place and show them more suitable options. Escape hatches can include links, a callout, or a note with useful context.

While procedural and conceptual documentation educate and inform, reference documentation is all about cause and effect: which actions produce which results.
#construction-of-reality 

It’s up to you to provide the reader with the right information at the right time. This is what’s meant by the flow of information
#progressive-disclosure #knowledge #information-architecture 

Of the different types of text you can put in your document, paragraphs contain the most information, but they’re the slowest to read and the hardest to skim.
#decision-making #linguistics 

There are two fundamental, paradoxical truths about readers of technical documentation: • Readers come to your documentation looking for information. • Readers read very little of what you write.
#paradox #communication #non-verbal-communication 

Every writer gets stuck. Writing is difficult, creative work, and creative work is sometimes hard to sustain. It’s not because you’re bad at writing! Getting stuck is part of the writing process, whether it’s floundering in the initial steps of creating your outline or somewhere in the middle of completing your draft.
#writing #creativity 

Templates provide reliable ways to create consistent documentation and simplify creating future documents. Templates create a consistent user experience. They make writing easier by letting you focus on content rather than structure.
#productivity #efficiency 

editing passes should focus on: • Technical accuracy • Completeness • Structure • Clarity and brevity
#documentation #process #processing 

Completeness is not the same as telling people everything. It’s as easy to lose readers with too much information as it is with too little. Completeness ensures you have enough documentation to help people who need it and not so much that they can’t find what they’re looking for.
#communication #clarity #precision

In general, documentation contains two types of code samples: executable and explanatory.

Avoid using foo, bar, acronyms, or gibberish terms that may mean a lot to your development team and not a lot to your reader. Terms like foo and bar may be familiar—even standard—to developers with a traditional background, but developers increasingly enter the field through nontraditional education and experience. It’s better to write looking forward than backward. Use descriptive strings in a consistent style to describe replacement data. For example, use strings like your_password or replace_with_actual_ [x].
#linguistics #anthropology #privilege #bias 

It only takes one incorrect or broken sample for your reader to lose trust in your documentation and by extension your software.
#trust #product 

Every reader approaches your documentation with a different level of comfort and confidence in using your software. Your documentation should support readers across the spectrum of comfort and familiarity by providing code samples with a range of complexity.

As with all automation and tooling choices, the trick is knowing when to invest the time and energy to make the results worthwhile. Automation could be right for you—but automation alone doesn’t solve usability and maintenance problems. Before automating something, consider whether the time and energy you’d invest might produce more helpful results if placed instead into your writing, editing, information architecture, user research, or the product itself.

Although reading may seem fast, it can be an incredibly inefficient process.
#non-verbal-communication 

Knowing how our brains process images and text helps us craft better content, down to the typography we choose. Your brain finds it easier to process simple unadorned typefaces because it can more easily recognize the curves and strokes of each letter like the ones used in a sans serif font. Reading UPPER CASE TEXT LIKE THIS is difficult because the letters are the same height and size. Variety helps comprehension.

In his book, Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art, Scott McCloud explores how comics are incorrectly interpreted as conveying less information. McCloud argues that by eliminating unnecessary detail, a comic’s true meaning is amplified. A good piece of art, or diagram, guides the user to understanding. To “simplify to amplify” as McCloud advises, you must keep your diagrams targeted to your users. Remember what you know about your audience and their task.

That said, documentation plays a critical role in addressing users’ needs and helping them understand your product and be productive. User feedback provides critical information on how your documentation and product perform, and your users often provide suggestions that you can use to improve both your content and your code.
#feedback #continuous-improvement #relationships

It’s important to take a “trust but verify” approach when evaluating user feedback issues. Users have good intentions when submitting feedback, but sometimes their feedback isn’t relevant to documentation, or the issue they’re describing has already been fixed.
#trust 

The more metrics you gather, the more you might feel adrift. The numbers can create an illusion of an answer. It’s easy to find yourself chasing more and more metrics without getting an answer to your initial question.
#data 

The functional quality of documentation can be broken down into the following categories:2 • Accessible • Purposeful • Findable • Accurate • Complete

For a document to be useful, it must clearly state its purpose or goal and then work to fulfill it.
#value-and-worth #success 

 Metrics for word count, time your users spend on a page, and consistency of language are easier to gather than whether or not a user is successful at accomplishing the documented task. That’s why before you begin collecting analytics, it’s important to first define what you’re looking to measure and improve.
 #data 
 
 To create an effective analytics strategy, clearly define the following: • Your organization’s goals and how they’re measured • Your reader’s goals and how they’re measured • Your documentation goals and how they’re measured
 #strategy
 
 The goal of automating documentation work is to eliminate toil. Toil isn’t just “work you don’t like to do”; toil has a specific definition in the world of software engineering:4 “Toil is the kind of work that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows.”(Betsy Beyer, Chris Jones, Jennifer Petoff, and Niall Richard Murphy, Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems 1st. ed., (O’Reilly, 2016)
