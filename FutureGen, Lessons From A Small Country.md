I am strongly of the belief that there are particular opportunities for a small country to be a test bed; to be smarter and more flexible than its larger neighbours. Here behaviour-change experiments can be piloted and new approaches forged.

We might be the poorest country in the UK, but we are innovators: at the forefront of genetic and Alzheimer's disease research, but also the world's first Fairtrade nation, a world leader in recycling, a U.K. leader in organ donation, one of the only countries in the world where 'you can walk the shape of a nation' along our coast and of course the first country in the world to legislate for future generations.

One of my favourite calls to action is often attributed to Margaret Mead, the anthropologist: 'Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.'

I was a part of nature and nature was a part of me. Together we were whole.

I think many people become activists by discovering that they are no longer prepared to tolerate particular actions.

At the simplest levels, my epiphanies were wake-up calls - a phrase I will use liberally to describe those moments of absolute clarity when you suddenly realise your own previous perceptions were wrong. To change perception, you have to change the system - and to change the system, you have to change perception - essentially, systemic problems require new systemic solutions.

Once you get the sustainability bug, you will find yourself on a lifetime of commitment to a roller-coaster ride against the tide, where for every step forward there will be more backwards. But just when you are feeling downhearted, some wonderful human being somewhere will give you hope - and off you go again.

I support the argument that sustainable development should have a common understanding the world over, which is why we used the Brundtland definition, but in becoming a guiding principle for an individual country, it has to be located in the spirit of that country's culture and place.

Jointly creating a 'slow, big win' which would demonstrate the value of the central organising principle approach.

It is also a success story, as, through this regulatory mechanism, Wales went from being one of the worst recyclers in the world to one of the very best in the world in a decade. The regulatory mechanism was the driver, as local authorities could then prioritise their own human and financial resources to delivering the agreed required outcomes.

Donella Meadows: "A network is non-hierarchical. It is a web of connections among equals, held together not by force, obligation, material incentive, or social contract, but by shared values and the understanding that some tasks can be accomplished together that could never be accomplished separately."

There is something quite disturbing about a dictionary - particularly a well-respected dictionary - helping children navigate a virtual world rather than help them recognise the species losses on their doorstep in the real one.

Law is different to policy. Policies can be changed in an instant; laws are more enduring and explicitly created to live longer than the governments that create them. Law therefore has a firmer intention behind it and requires a delivery mechanism that will satisfy a court. [...] Although ministers set direction, it is the civil servants who have to craft the outcome.

George Marshall, founder of Climate Outreach: "There is no single narrative for sustainability: there are a multitude, tailored to each distinct culture, and validating the traditions found in every country that connect people to land and nature."

The red kite has been subject to the longest continuous conversation project in the world. It is a proud symbol of conservation success and the power of humans to collaboratively intervene to tackle a known conservation problem. We have the knowledge; now let us exercise the will.

The words 'ecology' and 'economy' are derived form the same root - oikos. The words themselves have come from three Greek words: *oikos, logos, nomos*. Oikos means 'home': a place of relationships among all forms of life, sharing and participating in the evolution of the Earth community. Logos means 'the knowledge of our planet home' and nomos means 'the management of that home'. As knowledge should come before management, so ecology should come before the economy. But at economic powerhouse universities, the study of economics has no corresponding study of ecology. Thus, universities across the globe send millions of young people into the world equipped with management skills but without knowledge of what they are going to manage.
