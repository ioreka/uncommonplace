"Welcome to the world," sighed Dr Matthews. "The earth rotates from day to day. But no matter where we are, on its surface, we all get the same amount of moments. It's only how we spend them that matters."

Grandma laughed. "Everything was fantastical once upon a time. The more I learn about the universe, the more I understand I know nothing at all. I believe in the possibility that the world is not so certain as we might think and more magical than we can possibly comprehend. The fact that quasars exist at all was once beyond imagining, and now it's taken for granted. When I study distant objects in the sky, what I'm really doing is travelling in time. Some of the stars are so old their light is older than the planet I'm standing on to see them. So yes, I believe in the Shee because I believe we are merely ants in the library of knowledge. We will never understand what we don't know, and I think it's foolish to dismiss imaginative things out of hand merely because it doesn't fit out anthill."

"My own gran once let me pick one of her tomatoes in her garden. And I have no doubt her mother did the same before her. Time stopped for me, in that moment, and painted a picture of itself that I shall always have. Time is a daisy chain of memories, my dear, of paintings and snapshots, and some can take us outside of everything entirely. The universe is a vast, unknowable system, eternally expanding. And yet its basic, eternal truth is all wrapped up here, in red and green, in the taste of a humble tomato."

Ailsa loved being surrounded by books, because books are your best friends, and who doesn't want to be surrounded by their best friends?

"Those that live in the filth of the city would have you believe they feel themselves the more civilised sort, so very modern, somehow closer to you perhaps. But it's a shadow they are selling. A low and devious trick!"
