In the long stream of human history there was one school of thought that resurfaced time after time: a devotion to the hidden order of the universe and a blind faith in the natural balance of the world.

God was fair to all of His children, and Heaven took from overabundance to replenish scarcity. Fate ultimately guided all. Faced with signs of unfairness in the real world, people tried to marshal all kinds of evidence to comfort themselves: if Heaven endowed some with status, wealth, beauty, talent, health... then it was certain to take away something else as a price. When such evidence couldn't be found, the theory of reincarnation was invented so that there was infinite time to tally up the counters of lifetimes to achieve eventual balance. Kaizong had once scoffed at the theory of conversation of destinies, but perhaps people needed such a theory not because it was the truth, but because it offered solace in their limited lives.
