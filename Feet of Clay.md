People look down on stuff like geography and meteorology, and not only because they're standing on one and being soaked by the other. They don't quite look like real science. But geography is only physics slowed down and with a few trees stuck on it, and meteorology is full of excitingly fashionable chaos and complexity.

Summer isn't a time. It's a place as well. Summer is a moving creature and like to go south for the winter.

One of the advantages of a life much longer than average was that you saw how fragile the future was. Men said things like "peace in our time" or "en empire that will last a thousand years", and less than half a lifetime later no one even remembered who they were, let alone what they said or where the mob had buried their ashes. What changed history were smaller things. Often a few strokes of the pen would do the trick.

When you've made up your mind to shout out who you are to the world, it's a relief to know that you can do it in a whisper.
