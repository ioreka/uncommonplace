Introduction:
But, of course, for America to call itself the land of liberty is some kind of sick joke. It was built on the slave labour of millions of people - those shackled in ships and forcibly brought from Africa, and their descendants. Those thrown from the ships to drown in the ocean, those forced to wear their bodies out and to be moved from place to place without thought of family or kinship. It was built on the broken and abused bodies of those men and women, as it was on the shattered and murdered Native American peoples and the lands stolen from them.

It's the question of distance that is perhaps the most terrifying thing about Gilead. There is a way of thinking about the world that human beings have indulged in since the Enlightenment, and perhaps earlier than that. It is called 'progress'. Things, we tell ourselves, get better. We make scientific discoveries. We fight injustice. We outlaw bad actions and become morally more pure and righteous with every successive generation (you can see where this is going). We create shiny things, and our technologies make life easier every day. Our art becomes better, our lives become richer. We need never be worried that we will return to the past because it is impossible - we are progressing (whatever we try to repress tends to magnify). We make progress. Progress makes us. And yet, says Gilead. And yet.

We lived, as usual, by ignoring. Ignoring isn't the same as ignorance, you have to work at it.

In reduced circumstances you have to believe all kinds of things. I believe in thought transference now, vibrations in the ether, that sort of junk. I never used to.

Not a hope. I know where I am, and who. and what day it is. These are the tests, and I am safe. Sanity is a valuable possession; I hoard it the way people once hoarded money. I save it, so I will have enough, when the time comes.

But who can remember pain, once it's over? All that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh. Pain marks you, but too deep to see. Out of sight, out of mind.

What I need is perspective. The illusion of depth, created by a frame, the arrangement of shapes on a flat surface. 

Time's a trap, I'm caught in it.

You can't help what you feel, Moira said once, but you can help how you behave.

Better never means better for everyone, he says. It always means worse, for some.

_Falling in love,_ we said; _I fell for him_. We were falling women. We believed in it, this downward motion: so lovely, like flying, and yet at the same time so dire, so extreme, so unlikely.

As all historians know, the past is a great darkness, and filled with echoes. Voices may reach us from it; but what they say to us is imbued with the obscurity of the matrix out of which they come; and, try as we may, we cannot always decipher them precisely in the clearer light of our own day.
