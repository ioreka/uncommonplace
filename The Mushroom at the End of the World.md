The time has come for new ways of telling true stories beyond civilizational first principles. Without Man and Nature, all creatures can come back to life, and men and women can express themselves without the strictures of a parochially imagined rationality.

Below the forest floor, fungal bodies extend themselves in nets and skeins, binding roots and mineral soils, long before producing mushrooms. All books emerge from similarly hidden collaborations.

Furthermore, the questions that seemed to me worth pursuing emerged from knots of intense discussion in which I have been only one among many participants.

When Hiroshima was destroyed by an atomic bomb in 1945, it is said, the first living thing to emerge from the blasted landscape was a matsutake mushroom.

Grasping the atom was the culmination of human dreams of controlling nature. It was also the beginning of those dreams' undoing. The bomb at Hiroshima changed things. Suddenly, we became aware that humans could destroy the livability of the planet - whether intentionally or otherwise. 

In each case, I find myself surrounded by patchiness, that is, a mosaic of open-ended assemblages of entangled ways of life, with each further opening into a mosaic of temporal rhythms and spatial arcs. I argue that only an appreciation of current precarity as an earthwide condition allows us to notice this - the situation of our world. As long as authoritative analysis requires assumptions of growth, experts don't see the heterogenity of space and time, even when it is obvious to ordinary participants and observers. Yet theories of heterogenity are still in their infancy. To appreciate the patchy unpredictability associated with our current condition, we need to reopen our imaginations.

We are stuck with the problem of living despite economic and ecological ruination. Neither tales of progress nor of ruin tell us how to think about collaborative survival. It is time to pay attention to mushroom picking. Not that this will save us - but it might open our imaginations.

We hear about precarity in the news every day. People lose their jobs or get angry because they never had them. Gorillas and river porpoises hover at the edge of extinction. Rising seas swamp whole Pacific islands. But most of the time we imagine such precarity to be an exception to how the world works. It's what "drops out" from the system . What if, as I'm suggesting, precarity _is_ the condition of our time - or, to put it another way, what if our time is rupe for sensin precarity? What is precarity, indeterminacy, and what we imagine as trivial are the center of the systematicity we seek?

Precarity is the condition of being vulnerable to others. Unpredictabile encounters transform us; we are not in control, even of ourselves. Unable to rely on a stable structure of community, we are thrown into shifting assemblages, which remake us as well as our others. We can't rely on the status quo; everything is in flux, including our ability to survive. Thinking through precarity changes social analysis. A precarious world is a world without teleology. Indeterminacy, the unplanned nature of time, is frightening, but thinking though precarity makes it evident that indeterminacy also makes life possible.

Yet the modern human conceit is not the only plan for making worlds; we are surrounded by many world-making projects, human and not human. 

Many preindustrial livelihoods, from foraging to stealing, persist today, and new ones (including commercial mushroom picking) emerge, but we neglect them because they are not a part of progress. These livelihoods make worlds too - and they show us how to look around rather than ahead.
#progress 

Each organism changes everyone's world. Bacteria made our oxygen atmosphere, and plants help maintain it. Plants live on land because fungi made soil by digesting rocks. As these examples suggest, world-making projects can overlap, allowing room for more than one species.

If survival always involves others, it is also necessarily subject to the indeterminacy of self-and-other transformations. We change through our collaborations both within and across species. The important stuff for life on earth happens in those transformations, not in the decision trees of self-contained individuals.

During most of the twentieth century, many people - perhaps particularly Americans - thought that business carried forward the pulse of progress. Business was always getting bigger. It seemed to be increasing the world's wealth. It was effectively reshaping the world according to its goals and needs, so that people could be empowered by money and things for use and commercial exchange. All it seemed people had to do - even ordinary people without investment capital - was to tie their own rhythms to the forward pulse of business, and they too would move forward. This worked through scalability; people and nature could join progress by becoming units in its algorithm of expansion. Advancement, ever expanding, would move through them in tandem. 
All of that now seems increasingly strange. Yet experts in the business world seem unable to do without this apparatus for making knowledge.

Biologist Scott Gilbert and colleagues: "More and more, symbiosis appears to be the 'rule', not the exception. [...] Nature may be selecting 'relationships' rather than individuals or genomes."

As sites for more-than-human dramas, landscapes are radical tools for decentering human hubris. Landscapes are not backdrops for historical action: they are themselves active. 

The story of landscapes is both easy and hard to tell. 

Telling the story of landscape requires getting to know the inhabitants of the landscape, human and not human. 

For many cultural anthropologists, science is best regarded as a straw man against which to explore alternatives, such as indigenous practices.

Disturbance can renew ecologies as well as destroy them.

As an analytic tool, disturbance requires awareness of the observer's perspective - just as with the best tools in social theory.

Whether or not other organisms "tell stories", they contribute to the overlapping tracks and traces that we grasp as history. History, then, is the record of many trajectories of world making, human and not human.
