Star Trek was/is prophetic in so many areas, from communicators turning into mobile phones, to talking computers we now call Siri. In many cases, the transition from science fiction to science fact has been so direct that devices and products hit the market with Star Trek names.

The legacy of Star Trek and the role is has played in driving research and researchers must be honored. Star Trek may be entertainment, but it is entertainment with a sociological and technological edge. #anthropology 

Space is a violent place. The temperature can range from almost 300ºC in the sunlight to -100ºC in the shade of the International Space Station. Space suits have both heaters and air conditioners to keep astronauts from freezing solid or boiling. In deep space it gets even colder, just 2.7ºK above absolute zero (-270.45ºC). Exposure to the vacuum of space will cause bubbles to form in all tissues of the body; the worst imaginable case of the bends. Lungs will collapse and any air in a body space will expand and explode. If this doesn't do the poor astronaut in immediately, the radiation of space will blind them, burn their skin and mutate their DNA in a thousand different ways. Space is not to be messed with.

Have faith - Star Trek shows us how space can become less violent over time. Even though weapons are prevalent in Star Trek, their usage goes down as the different series progresses.

Everything we need to know about living together in space we can learn from Star Trek.

Aircraft fire missiles in air; ships fire torpedoes in water. There's no water in space, so why are photon torpedoes so named - because spacecraft are more often referred to as ships (spaceships, starships) than planes.

Sublethal or nonlethal weapons give the user a chance to contemplate his/her actions - just how much force do they need to exercise? This already makes space in the Star Trek universe a safer place than Earth in the 21st century. No handgun or rifle today and be dialed down from lethal to nonlethal.

Engineering is a matter of massaging technologies and mixing and matching them until a paradigm-shifting advance comes along.

After science develops a cheap or free way to deliver atoms, the aconomic motive will be lost and we will approach a post-scarcity society.

Science fiction isn't our best model for developing shields to protect astronauts in space. It turns out that our planet has its own shield and we can steal ideas from it. Stealing from Nature is a time-honored tradition in the physical and life sciences; the ways of the universe or a mystery yet we can still exploit them for fun and profit.

In physics, there is little difference between a push force and a pull force, each acts on an object in the same direction as the force. The distinction is found when putting them into practice.

Star Trek and other science fiction stories may have introduced us to the tractor beam, and that idea might very well end up saving us all. And isn't the pursuit of knowledge for the good of mankind the very essence of Star Trek?

The Universal Translator is the ultimate storytelling device for Star Trek; without it we wouldn't be celebrating the 50th anniversary of the franchise in 2016. 

Eve though the universal translator is more computer code than computer, the hardware is interesting and contains features that one might not realize. There are many aspects to a language that must be recognized and analyzed in order to receive all the meaning. Some of these aspects are outwardly seen, while others reside in the brain of the speaker.

As Clay Dillow wrote in a *Popular Science* piece on machine learning, "Text offers data; speech and all its nuances offers nothing but problems." (Dillow, 2014)

The task is daunting; the program must (A) figure out which sounds are speech, (B) separate the sound waves for specific sounds - math algorithms convert the sound wave bits into distinct sound bits and spaces, and (C) convert each sound bit to a speech sound (phoneme). Only then canstatistical software (D) combine phonemes to predict words by stringing phonemes together and guessing where the spaces between words are - this is called boundary word identification problem (letter boundary being a parallel problem in OCR). Finally, (E) programs test the output to see if it makes a coherent phrase or sentence.

Interestingly, the acoustic-phototactic clues used to identify spoken language have nothing to do with the semantics. It is not necessary for an algorithm to understand the language to verify it - people often know French when they hear it because it *sounds* French, not because they understand French.

Only after the translator device has detected text or speech and its particular languae of origin can it take on the task of translating the source language into the target language equivalent. This is a rigorous taks that requires machine learning capability and a vast amount of background data. One must dismiss the idea that translation software algorithms consist f huge databases of words in each language and the program swaps them out one for one. Instead, most use a translation model called a statistical machine translation (SMT) that employs existing databases of documents on the internet that exist in the source and the target languages. Compairons point out patterns, and the patterns can then be used to make predictions about the text to be translated. Patters are reinforced when noted many times and when they produce correct translations. Therefore, the statistics of pattern use within the large datasets help the algorithms make better predictions. This is the "statistical" of SMT. 

Mr Data sounds natural because his probablistic neural nets derive meaning and can shape that meaning into a proper soundscape, although nothing in Star Trek tells us whether he is a bottom up or concatenative speaker.

The UT learns a language as the speaker speaks it, but just what is it learning? A language is nothing more than a code that uses symbols, sounds and gestures to convery information between two organisms. It can be written, oral, gesture-based or a combination or all three. To learn an unknown or second language, there must be a transmission of linguistics clues from the speaker to the learner. 

Semantics is often the hardest thing for a translator or a human to decode; language users to often ignore the rules of semantics. Some things that produce misunderstandings include: *equivocation* - phrases with two meanings; *relative language* - gaining meaning through comparison; *static evaluation* - stating things in absolutes; and *abstraction* - language short cutes providing inexact meaning. *Characteristics of speech* - these also particupate in semantics. These include quality of voice, pitch, intonation, rate of speech, rhythm, stress, animation (body language), and context. Speech characteristics greatly affect meaning.

La Forge's VISOR was an important part of Star Trek. It represented a tangible example of the inclusion built into the franchise and the societal forward thinking that the writers demonstrated when telling stories of space exploration by a truly united Earth. 

The amount of computing power and speed needed to process a human's quantum pattern in an instant is almost unfathomable. The memory requirement alone is said to be inthe billions of kilquads (TNG: Realm of Fear) although how a kiloquad compares to a kilobyte is purely conjecture; the writers consciously kept the terms from sounding too much like current measurement system for somputers, "since reality frequently outstripts fiction when it comes to computer sciences" (Memory Alpha website.)

This "sense of place" provided by the Star Trek tricorder was instrumental in Google CTO Michael Jones' idea of what Google Earth should aspire to be.

What are the things we need to keep this trend going? People willing to observe and study nature to uncover its secrets, people willing to convert nature's talents into technologies, and people who can see the possibilities in nature and technology and show us how they might be used to improve ourl ives. Dedicated scientists and engineers have the first two items covered, and no one has shown us the possibilities better than Star Trek.
