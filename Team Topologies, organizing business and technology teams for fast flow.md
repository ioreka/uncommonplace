Organizations are constrained to produce designs that reflect communication paths #anthropology #communication #product #architecture 

Conway 1968 - "Given any particular team organization, there is a class of design alternatives which cannot be effectively purused by such an organization because the necessary communication paths do not exist"

Building and running these highly complex, interconnected software systems is a team activity, requiring the combined efforts of people with different skills across different platforms. In addition, modern IT organizations must deliver and operate software systems rapidly AND safely, while simultaneously growing and adapting to changes and pressures in the business or regulatory environment. Businesses can no longer choose between optimizing for safety and optimizing for speed.

Organizations that rely too heavily on org charts and matrices to split and control wotk often fail to create the necessary conditions to embrace innovation while still delivering at a fast pace. In order to succeed at that, organizations need stable teams and effective team patterns and interactions. They need to invest in empowered, skilled teams as the foundation for agility and adaptability. 
#power #productivity #performance 

As members of the technology teams managing these interfaces, we must shift our thinking from treating teams as collections of interchangable individuals that will succeed as long as they follow the "right" process and use the "right" tools, to treating humans and technology as a single human/computer carbon/silicon sociotechnical ecosystem. At the same time, we need to ensure that teams are intrinsically motivated and are given a real chance of doing their best work within such a system. 
#teamwork #culture #productivity #humans-and-machines 

By keeping things team-sized, we help to achieve what MacCormack and colleagues call "an 'architecture for paticpation' that promotes ease of understanding by limiting module size, and ease of contribution by minimizing the propagation of design changes."
#participation 

With open-plan offices and, particularly, with ubiquitous, instant communication via chat tools, anyone can communicate with anyone else. In this situation, one can accidentally fall into a pattern of communication and interaction where everyone NEEDS to communicate with everyone else (putting the onus on the consumer to distill what is relevant) in order to get work done. From the viewpoint of Conway's law, this will drive unintended consequences for the software systems, especially a lack of modularity between subsystems. 

Conway's law suggests that this kind of many-to-many communication will tend to produce monolithic, tangled, highly-coupled, interdependent systems that do not support fast flow. More communication is not necessarily a good thing. #moderation

As Naomi Stanford, author of Guide to Organisational Design, puts it: "people and organizations benefit from a diverse workforce where differences spark positive energy."

A computer will perform the same whether it is placed in Room A or Room B, but an engineer placed on Team A may perform very differently than is placed on Team B. 
#relativity #humans-and-machines 

Enabling teams is akin to the idea of "servant leadership" but applied to team interactions rather than individuals. 
#leadership #teamwork 

Robert Greenleaf: "do those served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, become healther, wiser, freer, more autonomous?"

Introducing new build and deployment tooling without tackling the underlying culture and development teams' skills can actually do more harm than good. 
#productivity #humans-and-machines 

A good platform provides standard, templaces, APIs, and well-proven best practices for Dev teams to use to innovate rapidly and effectively. A good platform should make it easy for Dev teams to do the right things in the right way for the organization; this applies to all kinds of product development, not just those involving software.
#platforms #architecture #work 

A platform team can provide a valuable management abstraction over the details of the platform.

Allan Kelly: "software developers love building platforms and, without strong product management input, will create a bigger platform than needed."

These platforms have all generally succeeded in reducing the complexity of the underlying systems while exposing enough functionality to be useful to the teams building on the platform. This drive to "simplify the developer's life" (Conway) and reduce cognitive load is an essential aspect of a good platform.
#communication #language #meaningfulness #complexity #simplicity #minimalism #cognition 

By aiming to reduce cognitive load on Dev teams, a good platform helps Dev teams to focus on the germane (differentiating) aspects of a problem, increasing personal and team-level flow, and enabling the team to be more effective. 

The team with a focus on support sits within the family or tribe of teams that are aligned to the same stream of change. In this context, the team providing support tends to evolve a greater awareness for the experience of the user of the whole service. 
#empathy #product #user-experience

For a fast flow of change to software systems, we need to remove hand-offs and slign most teams to the main streams of change within the organization. 
#efficiency #service-delivery #multidisciplinary-teams 

Many problems in delivering software come from accidentally unclear boundaries between different teams and their responsibilities. This is often shadowed by a software architecture with high coupling between its different parts (even if on paper the architecture was supposed to be highly modular and extensible) as Conway's law tells us. Such a system is commonly called a "monolith". 

We can and should break down a monolith by combining different types of fracture planes. #problemsolving 

Martin Fowler on bounded context: "DDD (Domain-Driven Design) is about designing software based on models of the underlying domain. A model acts as a ubiquitous language to help communication between software developers and domain experts. It also acts as the conceptual foundation for the design of the software itself - how it's broken down into objects or functions. To be effective, a model needs to be unified - that is, to be internally consistent so that there are no contradictions within it."
#systems-thinking #language #multidisciplinary-teams #organisation 

Michael Nygard: "A concept may appear to be atomic just because we have a single word to cover it. Look hard enough and you will find seams where you can fracture that concept." #perception 

With a monolith, every piece moves at the speed of the slowest part. 

Inevitably, you will find exceptions. The difficulty is understanding when an exception is valid and when an easy way to make quick progress ultimately limits effectiveness.

Mike Rother: ""The roots of Toyota's success lie not in its organizational structures but in developing capability and habits in its people."

Behavioural studies suggest that humans work best with others when we can predict their behaviour. As humans, we can build trust by providing consistent experiences for others in the organization. Clear roles and responsibilities help this by defining expected behaviour and avoiding what some refer to as "invisible electric fences". 
#social-contract #predictability #trust #anthropology #collaboration 

Teams interacting using the X-as-a-Servie mode should expect to emphasize the user experience of the thing being provided as a service. 

Don Reinertsen: "We need to be alert for the white space between the roles, gaps that nobody feels responsible for."

Modern organizations face huge challengers in responding to rapid changes in regulatory and market conditions, customer and user demands, rapidly-moving trends, and powerful shifts in technology capabilities. A successful modern organization needs to be able to shape-shift to deal with these changing circumstances by designing for adaptability. Therefore, when designing modern organizations for building and running software systems, the most important things is not the shape of the organization itself but the decision rules and heuristics  used to adapt and change the organization as new challenges arise; that is, we need to design the design rules, not just the organization. #growth-mindset #flexibility #architecture #work #organisation #feedback #continuous-improvement 

Collaboration is expensive. [\...] Collaboration is costly but good for discovery of new approaches.

John Kotter: "I think of [\strategy] as an ongoing process of 'searching, doing, learning, and modifying'... The more the organization exercises its strategy skills, the more adept it becomes at dealing with a hypercompetitive environment."
#competition #strategy 

Increasingly, software is less of a "product for" and more of an "ongoing conversation with" users. To make this ongoing conversation effective and successful, organizations need a "continuity of care" for its software. The team that designs and builds the software needs to be involved in its running and operational aspects in order to be ablet to build it effectively in the first place.
#feedback #continuous-improvement #product #humans-and-machines #user-experience 

Having separate teams for "new stuff" and BAU tends to prevent learning, improvement and ability to self-steer. It is a non-cybernetic approach. 
#cybernetics

An obsession with "feature delivery" ignores the human-related and team-related dynamics inherent in modern software.
