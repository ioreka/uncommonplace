Unfortunately, the advent of artifical festilisers has encouraged gardeners to forget many highly worthwhile and traditional skills to do with looking after soil.

Another way of looking at it is that, instead of digging, which does not increase fertility, you can spend the same amount of time in sourcing, making and spreading organic matter, which is improving the soil every year.

The presence of nutrients in soil does not automatically mean that plant roots can reach and use them. What is needed is a soil structure that allows roots to reach the nutrients, and soil life that enables roots to use them.

Think of soil as a living organism that needs to recover after being disturbed and that is upset by digging or rotavating. The word "recover" has two meanings and they both apply here: after being disturbed, soil re-covers itself with weeds, and the presence of weeds helps it recover in a general way, returning to a healthy state.
