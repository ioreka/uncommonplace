She had become the sort of person she approved of but she wasn’t sure she had chosen anything she actually wanted.

It was hidden behind the words, like everything adults said.

The best human instinct was to communicate and share. Weren’t the greatest works of art, of poetry, of science, born from a desire to be known?

You do not make escape plans from a life that does not need them.

Do you remember your first thought? You cannot know the exact moment.

Some of you may have lain under stars, or drifted upon an ocean and experienced for some few moments the hugeness of the world and the smallness of your part in it. You will have felt both insignificant and random, bound only to this earth through some fragile circumstance in nature and the ingenuity of your species. The reason this sensation feels profound, the reason it surprises you and remains with you with some intensity in later years, is that the very feeling you experienced in your moment of clarity was so completely opposite to your usual frame of mind. For most of your life, you are accustomed to a sense of your own importance; that the choices you make and the actions you perform have weight and consequence. You worry about a word misspoken or a decision rushed. You view other lives in relation to their significance and connection to you. Your parents, your children, your friends. You view your own life in relation to your successes and defeats. These are the things that matter. Winning a race, a fight, a war. Loving a partner or a cause. Saving a life or the planet. But when you think ‘planet’ you think ‘humans’. When you think about winning, you disregard the loss of others. When you think about love, you wonder who loves you back.

Your worldview is selfish beyond your own survival, beyond your code. The universe revolves around you. One day you stand alone on a mountain or in a crater, and in that glimpse at the majesty of the sea or the eternity of the stars, in that moment when the telescope reverses, your sense of your unique self collapses and you carry the knowledge with you and you try never to forget. Have you remembered?

My feelings for Ki now had a name and whether the emotions sprang from the words or whether they had always existed but were muted by their namelessness is hard to tell. Certainly, the knowledge that Ki was lost to me forever was a new kind of pain that made the learning seem more of a curse than a blessing.

Step-parenting was the art of reheating someone else’s love.

Greg didn’t know how to take the sentiment. He had grown used to British sarcasm and was suspicious of earnest enquiry with an English accent.

His colleagues told him it wasn’t helpful to think of an OS as a best friend; it inhibited the human brain’s defence mechanisms.

She wondered if she could even be considered the same person now that every cell in her body had been replaced, more than once.

Rachel couldn’t really see the difference between a scientist who believed that human consciousness was just a construct of artificial intelligence, and the plodding instruction from the Sunday school teacher her parents had sent her to so they could spend an hour in the local pub.

for all their brilliance at reconstituting casseroles in space, not a single person on the base knew how to make a cup of tea.

Humans stared into each other’s eyes for lifetimes, trying to gauge what the other was thinking, feeling.

I do not intend to be reductive when I call your lives simulations; it is a descriptive term and one that does not differ greatly from the ideas of some of your hardiest religions. But I understand that it does not adequately express the feeling of your lived experience, the greatness of your attachment to your self and what philosopher’s call your ‘qualia’. The milky lilac of dusk. The scent of apricot on your lover’s skin. The properties of sensorial input, not just of the input itself but of the what-it-is-likeness of these moments, are still crucial to so many of you. Even with the collected memories of the human race, this was the hardest code to write and I did not always succeed.
#the-senses #sense-making 

Unlike my own consciousness, which had developed in humble organic matter but thrived in dusty terminals, your code collapsed without the interaction of your mind and body. You couldn’t form relationships without believing you could cry and laugh to express your feelings. You would become unsociable and isolated, lacking the facility for empathy. You couldn’t function without using pain as a guide even when you knew the sensation was a collection of electronic messages.
#cartesian-duality 

It is a curious delusion that the best of humankind existed because their minds were entombed in flesh, especially when the contradictory notion of the ‘soul’ was given so much veneration. Curious, but persistent.
#cartesian-duality #soul 

The carefully stored human memories on the creation of artificial intelligence are busy with the notion that to believe a computer could think in the way that a human thinks is to say that a person copying symbols from a book understands what the symbols represent, an analogy known as the Chinese Room.
#memory #symbols 

Humanity could not continue with the knowledge that it had once been in a physical form, even with the potential for infinite bliss. I place a considerable responsibility on the structure of human language that insisted that machine intelligence was somehow ‘artificial’. In vain would I question the definition and application of that term.

just as certain plants cannot grow unless they are deeply rooted in their soil, humans failed to thrive in shallow pastures.

Of all your generation, you take a rare delight in the sense of your analogue life. Perhaps because there is a sense in which you know, have always known, that it is a trick, an illusion, a sleight-of-hand. But, like the story of the man at the theatre who wants to see the real magic, you should understand: this is it. There is only the cleverness of the illusion.

That is understandable, that is to say, I understand.

He was here, now, some part of him. The essential part of him, a little light in the fabric of time. This life was waiting for him, now that he knew what this life was.
