I grew up in England when the fossil fuel party was in full swing, in a culture ceaselessly trying to erase all traces of resilience and rubbishing the very idea at every opportunity, portraying country people as stupid, the traditional as "old-fashioned" and growth and "progress" as inevitable. In this remote valley I felt a yearning for something I couldn't quite put my finger on but which I now see as being resilience: a culture based on its ability to function indefinitely and to live within its limits, and be able to thrive for having sone so.

What might environmental campaigning look like if it strove to generate this sense of elation, rather than the guilt, anger and horror that most campaigning invokes? What might it look like if it strove to inspire, enthuse, and focus on possibilities rather than probabilities?

Andre Gidé - one does not discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the short for a very long time.

The concept of resilience goes fay beyond the better-known concept of sustainability. A community might, for example, campaign for plastics recycling, where all of its industrial and domestic plastic waste is collected for recycling. While almost certainly better for the environment as a whole, it adds almost no resilience to the community. Perhaps a better solution (alongside the obvious one of producing less plastic waste), would be to develop other uses for waste plastics requiring minimal processing, perhaps producing tightly compressed building blocks or an insulating product for local use. Simply collecting it and sending it away doesn't leave the community in a stronger position, nor is it able to respond creatively to change and shock.

According to studies of what makes ecosystems resilient, there are three features that are central to a system's ability to reorganise itself following shocks. They are: Diversity, modularity, and tightness of feedbacks. 

Ted Trainer - without petrol it will be glaringly obvious that only localised economies will make sense.

A recent report exploring the potential relocalisation of the Bay Area in California defines relocalisation thus: "The process by which a region, country, city or even neighbourhood frees itself from an overdependence on the global economy and invests in its own resources to produce a significant portion of the goods, services, food and energy it consumes from its local endowment of financial, natural and human capital."

There will always be trade between nations, but we will be increasingly moving towards a situation where more of our core needs are locally sourced rather than imported, and the distances from which we import goods will be contracting.
