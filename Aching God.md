Iâ€™ve learned from long experience, having spent many hours with both highborn and hayseeds, that the measure of a man or woman is contained within their character and conduct, not in outward trappings.

Were all prayers to any god no more than begging for mercy? From beings who possessed the power to make all suffering vanish if they saw fit to do so? Would he not end unnecessary pain for humankind if he had the power to grant it? Was devotion to the gods something so crude? A protection racket run by capricious, almighty thugs who lacked the elementary human kindness to alleviate suffering without abject pleading, or some form of payment?
