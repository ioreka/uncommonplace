Personally, in the course of acquiring a full bodysuit tattoo over the last eighteen years [...], I have never really had any clear idea why I wanted to get tattooed except that I find tattoos profoundly beautiful, alluring, joyful, strange and interesting. In getting tattooed, we participate (often unwittingly) in fascinating, complex, controversial, suppressed and entwined histories. The meanings of tattoos may be deeply personal, but they are also more than personal: signs in an ancient and continually expanding network of signs.

"It's strange to be talking about him," she interrupted herself. "I've never done it. He was the only man in the world. He was everything - clever, good, beautiful -" She stopped and glanced at me and laughed.

"That was in the brightest time, before words had crystallized what we felt. It was as bright and evanescent then as a rainbow, light and brightness and colour - and not either right or wrong, because unsaid and undefined. That was my happiest time."

For I believe this, and it is the groundwork of my airy edifice - that we seldom sleep without dreaming. At the close of day, when brain and body are alike wearied, we retire to bed gratefully, to sleep and to gather up new vigour for the morrow; but while our earthly husk reposes, slumbers, is dead but for the mechanical action of certain pulses, the brain - or rather the busy unresting Ariel which tenants that strange domicile - is far away, gathering from fresh woods and pastures new, from the cloudy, illimitable realms of dreamland, stores of strength and elasticity to meet the dull earthly requirements of the morrow. We awake, and we know not that we have been visitants of a strange mysterious land, that we have been enacting a part in some fantastic drama wilder often than the daydreams of the maddest poet. Whenever, in a morning, I feel my mind to be more than usually clear and buoyant, I say to myself, "Last night I had happy dreams." - Langholme

Since you will have us apart in this world I await another. - Mrs Gordon's Duke

There is an old joke that the only difference between tattooed and non-tattooed people is that tattooed people don't care if you're not tattooed.

Now that Barbie is tattooed, what is there to be offended about? Tattooing is available to everyone.
