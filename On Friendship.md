There seems to be nothing for which Nature has better prepared us than for fellowship - and Aristotle says that good lawgivers have shown more concern for friendship than for justice. 
#friendship #justice 

It is not my concern to tell the world how to behave (plenty of others do that) but how I behave in it: mihi sic usus est; tibi, ut opus est facto, face \[This is what I do: do what serves you\] #autonomy 

The more empty a soul is and the less furnished with counterweights, the more easily its balance will be swayed under the force of its first convictions.

But reason has taught me that, if you condemn in this way anything whatever as definitely false and quite impossible, you are claiming to know the frontiers and bounds of the will of God and the power of Nature our Mother \[...\] How many of the things which constantly come into our purview must be deemed monstrous or miraculous if we apply such terms to anything which outstrips our reason! \[...\] We out to judge the infinite power of Nature with more reverence and a greater recognition of our own ignorance and weakness.

Apart from the absurd rashness which it entails, there is a dangerous boldness of great consequence in despising whatever we cannot understand. 

It is a custom of our justice to punish some as a warning to others. For to punish them for having done wrong would, as Plato says, be stupid: what is done cannot be undone. The intention is to stop them from repeating the same mistake or to make others avoid their error. We do not improve the man we hang: we improve others by him. #intent

My horror of cruelty thrusts me deeper into clemency than any example of clemency could ever draw me. #cruelty #kindness 

Studying from books has a languid feeble motion, whereas conversation provides teaching and exercise all at once.

A man who will not go that far perhaps avoids the vice of superstition by falling into the vice of stubbornness. 

Has anyone ever acquired intelligence through logic? Where are her beautiful promises?

In my part of the country and during my own lifetime school-learning has brought amendment of the purse but rarely amendment of the soul. \[...\] This world is but a school of enquiry. The question is not who will spear the ring but who will make the best charges at it.

There is always an element of tyrannical bad temper in being unable to tolerate characters different from your own.

To sum up, we have to live among the living and let the stream flow under the bridge without worrying about it or, at very least, without making ourselves ill over it 
#consequences 

I would like to tell such men that the fruit of a surgeonâ€™s experience lies not in a recital of his operations nor in his reminding us that he has cured four patients of the plague and three of the gout, unless he knows how to extract from them material for forming his judgement and unless he knows how to convince us that he has been made wiser by the practice of his medical art. \[...\] It is not enough to relate our experiences: we must weigh them and group them, we must also have digested them and distilled them so as to draw out the reasons and conclusions they support.

Anyone who could discover the means by which men could be justly judged and reasonably chosen would, at a stroke, establish a perfect form of commonwealth.

Everything should bow and submit to our kings - except our intelligence. My reason was not made for bending and bowing, my knees were. 
#autonomy 

It is a disaster that wisdom forbids you to be satisfied with yourself and always sends you away dissatisfied and fearful, whereas stubbornness and foolhardiness fill their hosts with joy and assurance.
#self-worth 

The surest proof of animal-stupidity is the ardent obstinacy of opinion.

Every abridgement of a good book is a daft one.

Not to dare to talk roundly of yourself betrays a defect of thought.
