Your hard skills will help you get the job in the first place, but your people skills will help you succeed in your role.

If everyone within your business goes on the same journey, then your business as a whole can be transformed. If you’re all able to work well together, leading and inspiring team members and stakeholders across the business, then quality and velocity of team output increases. Off the back of this, happiness and wellbeing improve, which in turn increases staff morale, retention and team stability. This feeds back into quality, and velocity increases to create a virtuous circle.

Our research with 50 digital and product leaders revealed that 70% of team issues are caused by people skills deficiencies.

We generally think of conflict as being a negative thing, but people often create amazing ideas by disagreeing with the way something is done and then improving on it. The conflict may not have been in the form of an argument, but there was conflict nonetheless. Conflict can be a great thing and we mustn’t shy away from it. We all see the world differently so there’s always the potential to disagree with each other.
#conflict #perspective #the-scientific-method

The problem with conflict is that most people don’t have the skills to deal with it. Our fight or flight reaction often kicks in, so people either push hard for their viewpoint or don’t voice their opinion at all.
#growth-mindset 

Most of us have been brought up in an environment that’s modelled conflict resolution poorly. We’ve seen parents arguing with each other and struggling to resolve conflict in a collaborative, win-win way. As young kids, we’ve had parents pushing their opinions onto us with little regard for what we wanted to achieve. Then we grew up into teenagers and got our revenge by pushing our opinions onto our parents. In school, teachers rarely model conflict resolution well. With class sizes of twenty to thirty children, it can often feel like the overriding objective is for them to achieve obedience. Pupils are generally told to be quiet rather than voice disagreements.

The PLEASE framework harnesses the power of conflict to come up with amazing outcomes. I’ve used it – and seen it used – hundreds of times. At its core is the sentiment that anyone’s perspective on reality is 100% valid.

Keep your written message short and simple (the longer it is, the more likely it will be misinterpreted). For example: ‘I feel like we’re not working together as well as we could. Can we get together to chat about this? I’m keen to hear your perspective and for us to work out the best way forward.’
#non-verbal-communication 

Often, you’re not truly listening when another person is talking. You’re hearing what’s being said, processing the words, placing your own interpretation onto the message and then working out your response. Once you’ve worked out how you’d like to respond, the other person might as well stop talking because you’re not listening anymore. You’re just waiting for a pause so you can say what you want to say, or you might not be able to wait so you just interrupt (especially if you think what they’re saying is incorrect).

A joint Hokkaido-Yamagata University research study found that nodding can positively affect how likable and approachable you are by up to 30–40%.

Active listening involves putting the other person at the centre of the conversation.
#listening #solipsism #egocentricity #communication

Stop being right and obsessing about being correct. Focusing on the outcome and what success looks like is far more important.
#outcomes-driven #success #relative-correctness #prioritisation

No one can disagree with how you feel. Anyone can argue with a ‘fact’ because it’s unlikely to be one and far more likely to be your opinion. Even if you’re pretty sure that you’re right and everyone else agrees, it’s still just your opinion and the other person is entitled to have a different one.

Einstein is popularly misattributed as saying that if he had an hour to solve a problem, he’d spend fifty-five minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions.

Acknowledging success is important as it creates and maintains an upward spiral in your relationships with the people you work with.

Don’t make the other person wrong. Their opinion is valid no matter how strongly you disagree.
#relative-correctness #self-and-other 

Actively listen so they can empty out all their thoughts (drain that goldfish bowl). Only then should you think about responding. Take a stand for reaching a win-win outcome. It’s not OK for you to lose and it’s also not OK for the other person to lose.
#zero-sum #listening #dialogue #equity 

If you want to have strong, long-lasting relationships with people then negative behaviour simply can’t be present. Negative behaviour is any kind of behaviour that reduces another person’s wellbeing or growth as a person. It runs on a scale from mild to severe. At its most mild it can be a bit irritating; at its most severe you’ll likely feel that you’re being bullied.
#relationships #negativity #wellbeing #spectra

Everyone exhibits negative behaviour from time to time (although a small minority do it frequently). We don’t usually realise we’re doing it; we’re being triggered and are subconsciously reacting to the other person. On the occasions we do know we’re doing it, it’s often to protect ourselves as we believe the other person is exhibiting negative behaviour towards us.
#self-protection #trauma 

Negative behaviours can broadly be grouped into three categories: making other people wrong, making yourself correct, and gaining power.
#power #control #relative-correctness 

There are three ways to respond to negative behaviour: you can choose to not acknowledge it; you can call out the behaviour later or you can call out the behaviour in the moment.

Winning the battle is irrelevant if you lose the war.

If someone at work is annoying or frustrating you, then you’re the one that ends up carrying the emotional burden, not them.

As humans, we tend to take every experience we have and turn it into a story in our minds.

Leadership is no longer based on hierarchy. Leadership is getting people to perform to the best of their abilities while driving towards a shared goal.

You won’t find the path to success by focusing solely on your own goals. You might get a few quick wins doing this, but eventually people will cotton on that your only concern is for yourself. Why would they bother helping you if you don’t help them? In a world of matrix structures, we’re interdependent. You’re far more likely to tread the path to success if you go out of your way to help other people succeed.

Doing great work is only half the battle in garnering influence. You also need stakeholders to think you’re doing great work.
#communication #social-networks 

Whatever you do, don’t send a message out once and then have an attitude of, ‘I’ve told them now so it’s their fault if they don’t do anything about it,’ when you get no response. You’re responsible for the outcome, not just sending the message.

People like being with others that always think the best of them. Empathise and don’t make them wrong.

Remember, many senior stakeholders are Directors and Socialisers when it comes to communication style. They’re far more interested in the outcomes you’re going to help them achieve and far less interested in the work you’ve done and how you’re getting there.

People generally like to talk about their own beliefs and opinions – doing so activates the regions of the brain that are also responsible for the thrills of food, sex, money and drug addiction. That’s right, talking through your perspective can be as rewarding as food, sex, money and drugs!

Your day-to-day actions (or inactions) will build trust (or break it down), so take the time to get these right.

‘Do you mind if I challenge you?’, ‘Can I ask you a really blunt question?’ and, ‘Is it OK if I’m direct with you?’ are all great ways of getting a stakeholder to opt in to hearing what you’re going to say. Doing this manages their expectations, prepares them to be challenged and gives them ownership of this part of the conversation.

If someone hears you criticising or blaming other people, who’s to say you’re not going to criticise or blame them when they’re not around? You can focus your energy on pointing fingers or you can focus your energy on trying to resolve the situation and get to a positive outcome. I know which person I’d rather spend time with.

Our minds wander during 47% of our waking hours (according to a Harvard University study), so you can guarantee that people will get distracted during your meeting.

Storytelling is part art and part science.
#narrative #stories #science #art 

Listening to stories affects our brains in a way that regular conversation doesn’t even come close to doing. When you hear a story, the neural activity in your brain increases by up to five times. When more of your brain is at work, the chances that you’ll remember something increases exponentially. When your brain experiences an emotionally charged event like a story, it releases dopamine. Dopamine also makes it easier for you to remember what you’re hearing. You produce oxytocin when you’re being engaged with a story. This sends a signal to your brain that you should care about someone (ie the lead protagonist of the story). [...] It creates a level of empathy that wouldn’t otherwise exist.

A Stanford University research study showed that statistics alone have a retention rate of 5–10%, but when coupled with anecdotes, the retention rate rises to 65–70%.24 That’s an increase of up to fourteen times.

According to research from cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner, we’re twenty-two times more likely to remember a fact if it’s told in the form of a story.

Albert Mehrabian’s (oft-quoted) research found that what you say only accounts for 7% of the impact when you’re talking about feelings and attitudes. Tone of voice and body language account for 38% and 55% respectively, so when you use written comms, you’re losing up to 93% of the impact.

What you say and what the other person thinks you mean can be two different things.

What you don’t say in written comms can have as much of a negative impact as what you do say.
