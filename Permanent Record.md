What makes a life? More than what we say; more, even, than what we do. A life is also what we love, and what we believe in.

The freedom of a country can only be measured by its respect for the rights of its citizens, and it's my conviction that these rights are in fact limitations of state power that define exactly where and when a government may not infringe into that domain of personal or individual freedoms that during the American Revolution was called "liberty" and during the Internet Revolution is called "privacy".

Reality, I learned, is nearly always messier and less flattering than we might want it to be, but also in some strange way often richer than the myths.

From the Legend of Zelda, I learned that the world exists to be explored.

To refuse to inform yourself about the basic operation and maintenance of the equipment you depended on was to agree to that tyranny and agree to its terms: when your equipment works, you'll work, but when your equipment breaks down you'll break down, too. Your possessions would possess you.

I was fascinated by the thought that one individual programmer could code something universal.

Tech people rarely, if ever, have a sense of the broader applications and policy implications of the projects to which they're assigned.

This is the origin of all hacking: the awareness of a systemic linkage between input and output, between cause and effect. Because hacking isn't just native to computing - it exists wherever rules do. To hack a system requires getting to know its rules better than the people who created it or are runnign it, and exploiting all the vulnerable distance between how those people had intended the system to work and how it actually works, or could be made to work. In capitalizing on these unintended rules, hackers aren't breaking the rules as much as debunking them.

Humans are hardwired to recnogize patterns. All the choices we make are informed by a cache of assumptions, both empirical and logical, unconsciously derived and consciously developed. We use these assumptions to assess the potential consequences of each choice, and we describe the abilitiy to do all of this, quickly and accurately, as intelligence. But even the smarted among us rely on assumptions that we've never put to the test - and because we do, the choices we make are often flawed.

Technological innovation tends to outpace all moral, ethical, and legal restraints.

One major irony here is that law, which always lags behind technological innovation by at least a generation, gives substantially more protections to a communication's content than to its metadata - and yet intelligence angencies are far more interested in the metadata - the activity records that allow them both the "big picture" ability to analyze data at scale, and the "little picture" ability to make perfect maps, chronologies, and associative synopses of an individual person's life, from which they presume to extrapolate predictions of behaviour. In sum, metadata can tell your surveillant virtually everything they'd ever want or need to know about you, except what's actually going on inside your head. 

To my true regret, we never went [to Hiroshima or Nagasaki]. Those places are holy places, whose memorials honour the two hundred thousand incinerated and the countless poisoned by fallout while reminding us of technology's amorality.

The chain of command is truly and chain that binds, and the lower links can only be lifted by the higher. 

Ultimately, every language, including English, demonstrates its culture's relationship to power by how it chooses to define the act of disclosure. 
#language #culture #anthropology 

What makes one disclosure permissable, and another not? The answer is power. The answer is control. A disclosure is deemed acceptable only if it doesn't fundamentally challenge the fundamental prerogatives of an institution. 

That's the incomparable beauty of the cryptological art. A little bit of math can accomplish what all the guns and barbed wire can't: a little bit of math can keep a secret.
