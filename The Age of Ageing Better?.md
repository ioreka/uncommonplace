Financial services are stuck in an outdated model of the three-stage life. It is clear that government will have to play an active role in creating a regulatory framework that encourages saving, ensures everyone has access to affordable and impartial information and advice to manage their money at every stage of life, not just those who have a large pot on retirement, and that those providing the products are encouraged to innovate and respond to the needs of future, as well as current, retirees. \[...\] Even if people save privately towards a pension for most of their life, it’s unlikely to provide people with sufficient money to spend a third of their life in retirement. Whatever changes are made to both the state or private pensions, the fact is that if we want financial security in later life we will need to work longer.

The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS), an industrial relations organisation, has suggested this conversation should be handled carefully, with all employees asked their plans for short, medium and long term, to avoid the impression of targeting a specific worker of a certain age. Career conversations should be the norm throughout someone’s working life and so asking about future plans can open up conversations about whether someone is thinking about stopping work.

The prospect that more of us will live to 100 will also mean more of us restarting second or third careers later in life.
  

The UK  has the third-worst rate of job-related training in the OECD for over 50s. Often the focus is on teaching technical skills, but these become obsolete very quickly, and need to be learnt and relearnt, often on the job. The skills that are important to maintaining resilience and sustaining a longer working life may be softer skills such as adaptability and flexibility.

The 100-year life will also require people to re-think their work-life balance across the life course in order to preserve health and vitality to sustain a longer working life.

Far from the growth in older workers being a threat to the jobs of younger workers, ther is a real and pending risk that as the 1960s baby boomers leave the workforce, the UK will face a labour and skills shortage. It will need employers to radically shift their focus and practices to create more age-friendly employment opportunities by: embracing flexibility in all its forms; eliminating age bias in the recruitment process; supporting workers with health conditions and caring responsibilities to manage these and remain in work; investing in the training and progression of older workers; and creating an age-positive culture in which the diverse contributions of workers of all ages are harnessed.

Charles Booth (1898): “Ideal condition of old age: physical comfort; independence; the power to give as well as receive.”
#autonomy 

Society has a nasty habit of demonising those who don’t or can’t work. According to those who frame growing older negatively, older people are a burden. If you are no longer working, you are not contributing economically, and if you are a pensioner, you are also likely to be costing the rest of us money. This is based on a very narrow economic view of the world \[...\] Such \[other\] activities are often undervalued by society, because they don’t generate direct economic contributions in the form of taxes, and yet they generate social value.

In most sectors of the economy, technology brings down the costs of products and services. In health care, technological advances and medical innovations can often increase the costs of providing care. We’re not seeing robots look after people - in fact, new technology rarely substitutes for human care - but instead more specialist surgical procedures and new drug therapies require more highly trained and specialist staff, who are usually paid more to reflect their longer training.

The fact is that only around 2 out of 10 people who are resuscitated in hospital survive and leave hospital, and the survival rates in other settings are even lower, yet at every step things are geared towards intervention, even when survival is unlikely. A more fundamental change in the approach to end of life care is needed if we are to reduce this overtreatment.

Facing up to death as the one certainty in life opens up the possibility of having conversations and planning ahead, which might give us a higher chance of a good death when it comes.

People living in areas like Kesington and Chelsea in London can enjoy, on average, 18 more years of good health compared to people in places like Blackpool or Manchester. This is a scandal and has far-reaching implications.

The reality is that those of us who are educated and reasonably well off enjoy not only longer lives, but also live longer in good health than people on lower incomes. There are growing inequalities in the experience of ageing. 
#edustion 

Dr John Beard: In setting policy, we must not reinforce those inequities. We should not just be thinking about raising the average wellbeing of older people, we must give particular attention to those at the bottom, so we can raise their rate disproportionately to the rich and narrow the gap.

While the woes of the NHS are often blamed on the rising numbers of older people, the reality is that many of these patients require social care, not medical care.

It’s a surprise to some to understand that ill health and disability are not an inevitable part of ageing. Our chronological age is associated with a higher prevalence of many diseases, but there is huge variability in health status among people of the same age. Most disease is caused by a combination of genetics, lifestyle and environmental factors. Chronological age is therefore not a useful indicator of someone’s health, fitness or capability. 

Biologically speaking, ageing begins at 30 or even earlier. Things do gro wrong and things wear out. This process is called senescence, and it refers to the decline in organ and cell function that occurs from repeated use. To over simplify, if you imagine the body as a machine, the more it’s used the more worn the cogs become, but a well-oiled engine and one that is regularly serviced will last longer than one that has had no maintenance. 

The current system, which rests on defining what is health care and what is social care, what is nursing care versus personal cafe, who is eligible for NHS Continuing Care and who isn’t, what different levels of need for care people have and how many assets people have, leaves families bewildered and professionals unable to deliver high-quality care in the most suitable setting for an individual. 

There is strong evidence that strength and balance exercises can reverse muscle wasting and thereby prevent falls.

If we are to provide high-quality care and support for everyone in future, there needs to be a revolution in care-giving. 

The 16 design features of a lifetime home (factors which must be considered): car parking width, access from car parking, approach gradients to entrance, entrance space and design, communal stairs and lifts, doorways and hallways, wheelchair accessibility, entrance-level living room, entrance-level WC and shower drainage, entrance-level bedspace, bathroom and WC walls, stair life/through-floor lift, tracking hoist route, bathroom layout, window specification, location of service controls

The focus of health and care policy has tended to be on keeping people in their homes for longer and ‘maintaining independence’. This reflects concerns for service providers and funders about the high costs of residential and nursing care if people have to be admitted to an institutional setting. But we must challenge the idea of ‘ageing in place’ if this means remaining in the same home even if it’s to the detriment of health or quality of life. The focus needs to be on the person and whether the home environment enables people to live the life they want to lead day to day. 

Research by the Centre for Ageing Better has suggested that the best outcomes are achieved when individuals, families and carers are closely involved in the decision-making process, focussing on individual goals and what a person wants to achieve in the home.

Even if we could create different opportunities for people all ages to engage in community activities, if we are to take a preventative approach, we need to hardwire social connections into the fabric of our communities. 
#community 

We must build intergenerational consensus on the changes that are needed. This can’t be about old versus young. Rather, it’s about how we create a society that everyone - regardless of their age, income or background - can enjoy at every stage of life.
