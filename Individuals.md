“Computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty. Programmers who subconsciously view themselves as artists will enjoy what they do, and will do it better.” — Donald Knuth

The seven faced god has cheated me. My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay, twisted into this rude shape you see before you - Tyrion Lannister

You told me once that a soul isn't something a person is born with but something that must be built, by effort and error, study and love. And you did that with more dedication than most, that work of building a soul - not for your own benefit but for the benefit of those that knew you.

I cried that night. But not for what we lose. It is who we are that moves me, time and again, in the hospice. When people ask me if my job is depressing, I reply that nothing could be further from the truth. All that is good in human nature – courage, compassion, our capacity to love – is here in its most distilled form. So often, so reliably, I witness people rising to their best, on facing the worst. I am surrounded by human beings at their finest. #rachelclarke [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/18/all-that-is-good-in-human-nature-is-here-rachel-clarke-on-life-and-death-at-her-nhs-hospice](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/18/all-that-is-good-in-human-nature-is-here-rachel-clarke-on-life-and-death-at-her-nhs-hospice)

Don’t live each day as if the world is ending. That would be a disaster. Live your life as if you’re not sure whether your time on this earth is ending or not. Get your shit together. Handle what’s important. Take care of others. Enjoy yourself. Be at peace. #ryanholiday 

The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they’re exceptional. On the contrary, they become amazing because they are obsessed with improvement. And that obsession with improvement stems from the belief that they are in fact, not that great at all. It’s anti-entitlement.

People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great. That they’re mediocre. They’re average. That they could be so much better. #markmanson

The rain falls. The sun shines. The wind blows. And that’s what it’s like. We are buffeted by this, by that, and it is nothing to do with you. Someone you love dies, or leaves. You get ill or you get better. You grow old and you remember, or you forget. And all the time, everywhere, there is this canopy stretching over you… - #ONSIND, “Kim Kelly is still my best friend” (taken from The Singing Detective)

“The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him.” -  Leo Tolstoy

  

Humble leaders know they don’t have all the knowledge or answers and therefore they actively listen to learn.

Looking beyond the games industry, the unambiguous splitting of consciousness from the body proposed by dualism is arguably at the root of many cultural ills. It has been used to claim that non-human animals are just biological contraptions, for instance, to be abused and slaughtered with impunity. The carving away of mental from physical phenomena has also contributed to an obscuring of the relationship between one's social or economic circumstances and mental health: hence the diminishing expression, "it's all in your mind". The principles of connectedness, of entangled minds, bodies and environments, that riddle the gray matter of a game like Final Fantasy 15 suggest more sustainable ways of thinking about thinking. They are a much-needed incentive to keep asking the question of who and what we are and where, exactly, we end. Edwin Evans-Thirlwell

Sleep is still most perfect, in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved. The warmth, the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from the touch of the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body and soul completely in its healing.

Jasper Fforde - using science fiction offers a means for self-reflection; a distancing in order to look back at ourselves, rather than a simple escape from the everyday. \[...\] How daring it was in 1959 to suggest that the point was there was no point, and that instead of looking for grand answers in the expansive 'out there', we should be looking within ourselves for guidance rather than abrogating our moral and human responsibilities to external ideologies, whether they be political, religious or economic. 

The moral: Money, position, health, handsomeness, and talent aren't everything.

Periphery is an illusion of individual consciousness. Each of us in our own mind is the center of the universe, and everything falls off in direct relation to its proximity or importance to us. But if you move to the periphery of your own existence, you find it to be the center of someone else’s. Now I feel a responsibility to Keith. I can’t dismiss him anymore. I’m not sure I like that. Maybe it’s easier to see people as peripheral. Maybe that’s why we do it. It’s a weird and daunting experience to let other people in their fullness into our minds. It is so much easier to see them as serving a purpose in our own lives. Charlie kaufman

As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn’t as easy to get programs right as we had thought. We had to discover debugging.

Suzy England OT - "This is in part about how we work, such as the shift to electronic patient records and digital outpatient appointments. But it is also about how we need to support our patients and service users with digital skills, and which technological solutions can help deliver care and enable people to do more. The ways in which we all work, live and communicate are digitalising fast and we need to make sure we can help them engage with the activities they want to do."
