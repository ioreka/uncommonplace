I learned that most every man or woman seeks nothing more than their own contentment, doing the best they can to navigate themselves through life’s mystery. I’ve fallen short of the man I want to be myself, many times, and I’ve tried to atone when I can. But I’ve never worried much about the man others thought I should be.

Show care, my friend, for those choices you make, and how they might sever the life threads of those we hate, or disdain, as well as those whom we love.
