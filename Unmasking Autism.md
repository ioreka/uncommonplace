Usually, it's white boys with conventionally "masculine" interests and hobbies that are flagged as potentially Autistic when they are young. Even within that relatively privileged class, it's almost exclusively wealthy and upper-middle-class Autistic kids who get identified. That group has always been the prototype for Autism when it's described by clinicians or depicted in the media. All the diagnostic criteria for Autism are based on how it presents in this group.

When an Autistic person is not given resources or access to self-knowledge, and when they're told their stigmatized traits are just signs that they're a disruptive, overly sensitive, or annoying kid, they have no choice but to develop a neurotypical facade. Maintaining that neurotypical mask feels deeply inauthentic and it's extremely exhausting to maintain. It's also not necessarily a conscious choice. Masking is a state of exclusion forced onto us from the outside.

Conforming to neurotypical standards can earn us tentative acceptance, but it comes at a heavy existential cost. Masking is an exhausting performance that contributes to physical exhaustion, psychological burnout, depression, anxiety, even suicidal ideation. Masking also obscures the fact that the world is massively inaccessible to us. If allistics (non Autistics) never hear our needs voiced, they have no reason to adapt to include us.

Refusing to perform neurotypicality is a revolutionary act of disability justice. It's also a radical act of self-love. But in order for Autistic people to take our masks off and show our real, authentically disabled selves to the world, we first have to feel safe enough to get reacquainted with who we really are. 

Though the book's focus is masked Autistic people, I have found there is considerable overlap between Autistics and other neurodiverse groups. Many of us share mental health symptoms and traits and have overlapping or comorbid diagnoses. All of us have internalized mental illness stigma and felt the shame of deviating from what's considered "normal". Almost every person with a mental illness or disability has been crushed under the weight of neurotypical expectations, and has repeatedly tried and failed to earn acceptance by playing the rules of a game that was designed to harm us. And so, for nearly every neurodiverse person, the journey toward self-acceptance involves learning to unmask.

Similarly, Autistic brains differ from allistic brains in how excitable our neurons are. To put it in very simple terms, our neurons activate easily, and don't discriminate readily between a "nuisance variable" that our brains might with to ignore (for example, a dripping faucet in another room) and a crucial piece of data that deserves a ton of our attention (for example, a loved one beginning to cry quietly in the other room). This means we can both be easily distracted by a small stimulus and miss a large meaningful one.
#the-brain #processing 

- We are hyperreactive to even small stimuli in our environment
- We have trouble distinguishing between information or sensory data that should be ignored versus data that should be carefully considered
- We are highly focused on the details rather than the "big picture"
- We're deeply and deliberatively analytical
- Our decision-making process is methodical rather than efficient; we don't rely on mental shortcuts of "gut feelings"
- Processing a situation takes us more time and energy than it does for a neurotypical person

While understanding the biology of human difference is helpful in a lot of ways, there are real risks to reducing a disability to its physical "causes". It can lead people to believe that our biology is our destiny, and that we are lesser to neurotypicals in some unchangeable way. In fact, some research suggests that when people understand disabilities such as depression and ADHD as being purely biological, they actually show more stigma towards people with those conditions, not less. The idea that a disabled group _can't help being the way they are_ is dehumanizing and restrictive, even though some also find it liberating and validating.

Being identified formally as disabled is very much a double edged sword.

I don't function "highly" in every single realm of my life, but I am able to get by more easily than many other Autistics. My acceptance in society is conditional on my behaving respectably and being productive.

It's an all-too-common experience for disabled people, being told that your skills in one area are proof that you're "not trying hard enough" in another.

When it comes to mental illness and disability, diagnostic categories are really flawed things. A disorder is a cluster of symptoms and traits that tend to go together, and the way those clusters are organized tends to change over time.
#classification #time #linguistic-relativity 

For all these reasons, it's not always possible (or helpful) to try to untangle which of a person's traits are Autistic and which are caused by the trauma of being neurodiverse in a neurotypical world.

It is not cultural appropriation or "faking a disability" to try out these tools. If Autism-friendly resources and adaptations prove helpful for you, that's another key signal you belong in our spaces, or at the very least have a great deal in common with us.

Behind each mask, there sits a deep pain, and a series of painful beliefs about who you are and what you must never allow yourself to do. Consequently, a big part of unmasking will mean facing those qualities you loathe the most in yourself, and working to see them as neutral, or even as strengths.

Many Autistic people who work in tech gravitate to the field because Autism spectrum traits are somewhat normalised there.

Though masking is incredibly taxing and causes us a lot of existential turmoil, it's rewarded and facilitated by neurotypical people. Masking makes Autistic people easier to "deal" with. It renders us compliant and quiet. It also traps us. Once you've proven yourself capable of suffering in silence, neurotypical people tend to expect you to do it forever, no matter the cost.

You cannot craft a comfortable or worthwhile life if you don't know who you really are, or if you self-image is shaped entirely by rules imposed on you by other people.
#meaningfulness #self-awareness 

A noncompliant child may be stressful to raise, but if you want your kid to become a strong, healthy person with the power to self-advocate, it's crucial they know how to stand up for themselves and say "no."

Many of us have been stifling our large emotions for years - not just distress and discomfort, but joy as well. By happily delving into our special interests and reveling in our Autistic capacity to hyperfocus, we can help retrain our brains to see our neurotype as a source of beauty rather than a mark of shame.
#shame #hyperfocus #neuroplasticity 

Being Autistic in a neurotypical world is often traumatizing, and being forced to mask is essentially an example of society-driven abuse.

We can't please everyone. Unmasking means we stop trying to be an appealing "brand."

Experimental research shows that many people have trouble ignoring visual "noise", to the degree it really disrupts our processing.

The more honest we are about the challenges we're facing, the harder it will be for neurotypical people to ignore our voices, or the fact that most public spaces are still incredibly inaccessible. Being more radically visible is also an exercise in unlearning shame.

A masker gets their needs met in private, through a series of apologetic half measure and veiled coping mechanisms; a radically visible person openly declares who they are and what they require, because it's what they deserve.

Many neurotypes simply are not suited to long workdays, lengthy commutes, nuclear families, and isolated "independence." Arguably, none of us are well suited for that the nine-to-five workday is not evidence-based but some of us suffer more visibly and pervasively than others. By tearing down our current, constricting definition of mental health, and celebrating different ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving, we can improve countless lives. By reworking society to make it more flexible and accommodating of difference, we can improve the mental and physical health of all people. In this way, un-masking is a political goal.

As Reese Piper put it, "It's neurotypicals who categorized autism as a social disorder." Autistic people don't actually lack communication skills, or a drive to connect. We aren't doomed to forever feel lonely and broken. We can step out of the soul-crushing cycle of reaching for neurotypical acceptance and being rejected despite our best efforts. Instead, we can support and uplift one another, and create our own neurodiverse world where everyone including neurotypicals is welcome.

When neurodiverse people push for more explicit messaging, everybody benefits. Vague, symbolic communication is harder to parse if you're Deaf or hard of hearing, an immigrant from a different culture with different idioms, a nonnative English speaker, or a person with social anxiety. The more elaborate and symbolic a culture is, the more difficult people from outside the culture will find it to navigate. In some instances, this is done as a deliberate method of gatekeeping and exclusion. Academics are trained, for example, to write in a very dry, passive, and jargon-filled way, as a sign of our intellect and seriousness. Because it is hard to understand academic writing and it's only really taught within the academy, being able to follow it becomes a sign you "belong." But hard-to-understand writing is, by definition, less effective writing. Similarly, the business world relies on hyperspecific jargon and a variety of sports metaphors, which can leave those unfamiliar with its macho culture and communication style quite excluded. Tearing down barriers like these is essential to building a diverse, fluid community that is capable of evolution and growth.
#communication 

It's very difficult for us to unhitch our self-images from neurotypical expectations, slow down, and build a life that really reflects the people we want to be. Almost every Autistic person I spoke to has found that in order to build a life that suits them, they've had to learn to let certain unfair expectations go, and withdraw from activities that don't matter to them. It's scary to allow ourselves to disappoint other people, but it can be radical and liberating, too. Admitting what we can't do means confronting the fact we have a disability, and therefore we occupy a marginalized position in society-but it also is an essential part of finally figuring out what assistance we need, and which ways of living are best for us. You have to be able to say no to certain unreasonable expectations in order to genuinely say "yes" to the things you care about.

Under a capitalist, Industrial Time framework, any project that is abandoned or left unfinished is seen as a "failure"-time wasted be-cause it didn't result in a clear end product. But when we look at time as a series of cycles or spirals with goals that are ever-shifting, we can recognize that the learning and reflection we put into an aborted project (or even into masking) often pays off, just not in the way we expected. Every disappointment or failure teaches us something about what we want, and what is best for us.

To wrap up this chapter, I'd like to ask you to reflect on the meaningful things Autism has already brought into your own life. These positives don't have to be respectable by neurotypical standards. Most of us aren't genius savants, and our worth should not be measured by our ability (or inability) to meet conventional benchmarks of success. What's really important here is to focus on how neurodiversity has brought pleasure, connection, and meaning to your life.

Interestingly, adults are only shamed for having an obsessive interest if that interest is a bit too "strange," and doesn't come with the opportunity to rack up a lot of achievements or make a lot of money. People who routinely complete eighty-hour workweeks aren't penalized for being obsessive or hyperfixated; they're celebrated for their diligence. If an adult fills their evenings after work learning to code or creating jewelry that they sell on Etsy, they're seen as enterprising. But if someone instead devotes their free time to something that gives them pleasure but doesn't financially benefit anyone, it's seen as frivolous or embarrassing, even selfish. In this instance, it's clear that the punishing rules imposed on Autistic children reflect a much broader societal issue: pleasure and nonproductive, playful time are not valued, and when someone is passionate about the "wrong" things, that passion is discouraged because it presents a distraction from work and other "respectable" responsibilities.

Many masked Autistics are sent to gifted education as children, instead of being referred to disability services. Our apparent high intelligence puts us in a double bind: we are expected to accomplish great things to justify our oddness, and because we possess an enviable, socially prized quality, it's assumed we need less help than other people, not more.

Psychiatrists and psychologists have always defined Autism by how the disability impacts neurotypical people. A more "severely" Autistic person is not necessarily a person who experiences more interior suf-fering, but rather someone who suffers in a more disruptive, annoying, or disturbing way. The Autistic children who present the biggest hassle are the ones most likely to be referred to services, whereas those who can conceal their struggles are granted tentative approval-but risk never being understood or empathized with.

In the psychological literature on the subject, Autism masking is said to consist of two classes of behavior:
- Camouflaging: attempting to hide or obscure Autistic traits in order to "blend in" with neurotypicals. The main goal of camouflage is to avoid detection as disabled.
- Compensation: using specific strategies to "overcome" challenges and impairments related to disability. The main goal of compensation is to maintain the appearance of high, independent functioning.

When neurotypical people equate "functioning" with being less disabled, they fail to recognize the immense, hidden labor that goes into appearing normal. It also misses just how oppressive having to seem normal is by itself. 

Neurotypical people are obsessed with functioning levels. If you tell a nondisabled person that you're Autistic, but you're able to hold a conversation or maintain a job, they'll immediately start gushing about how functional you are. Usually, that remark comes with the implication that you don't really count as disabled because you can fake a nondisabled status (if only for a moment). 

I love that every Autistic person has their own unique relationship to these labels, and their own thoughts. Our disagreements show that the Autistic community is diverse, filled with people who form their own opinions and speak their minds. We're not a monolithic group, and our individual journeys shape how we express our identities to the world. I've done my best in this book to honor the terminology each individual Autistic person uses for themselves. This means that some-times I'll call someone a "person with Autism" or a "low-functioning" person, even though self-advocacy groups have good reasons to dis-courage allistics from using such words thoughtlessly. If someone self-identifies as an Aspie or as having Asperger's, I'll accurately reflect that as well. I hope that even if you have specific stances on which terms you like and dislike, you can respect my interview subjects' agency to name themselves, as I have strived to do.
#semantics #naming #identity 

Throughout this book, I capitalize "Autistic" for the same reason mem-bers of the Deaf community capitalize "Deaf"-to indicate it is a part of my identity I am proud of, and to signal Autistics have our own culture, history, and community. Since Eugen Bleuler first coined the word in the early 1900s, Autism has largely been used in negative and dehumanizing ways, and to this day many parents and educators are still deeply frightened by it. By capitalizing Autism, I signal that it's actually an important, meaningful aspect of who we are, one we don't need to shy away from.

I do think that when allistic people declare that everyone is a little Autistic, it means they are close to making an important breakthrough about how mental disorders are defined: why do we declare some peo-ple broken, and others perfectly normal, when they exhibit the exact same traits? Where do we draw the line, and why do we even bother doing so? If an Autistic person benefits from more flexibility at work, and more social patience, why not extend those same benefits to everybody? Autistic people are a normal part of humanity, and we have qualities that can be observed in any other non-Autistic human. So yes, everyone is a little bit Autistic. That's all the more reason to broaden our definition of what is deserving of dignity and acceptance.
