The elements that make up the bodies of plants and animals are finite, and for life to proceed on Earth they must be continuously recycled from one generation to the next. Key to this is the process of decomposition, which begins as soon as organisms die. Their organic components are consumed by bacteria and fungi as well as by larger creatures, such as worms and beetles, all of which break them up into smaller compounds. These compounds are then absorbed by the roots of living plants, which in turn die or are eaten, so continuing the cycle of life, death, and decomposition.

The soil in ancient woodland will be much older than any of the trees, having been created over millennia. Some bulbs and fungi will also be older than the trees.

The process of composting and recycling is slow - just 1cm (1/2 inch) of topsoil can take more than 1,000 years to form.

Soils take centuries to form, yet they can be eroded in a matter of moths. In fact, the United Nations has estimated that the world loses 24 billion tonnes of fertile soil each year. While gardeners cannot change poor agricultural practices or prevent urbanization, we can play a small part in reducing soil erosion and our compost heaps will help us. Compost promotes good soil structure that trap water and support strong, healthy root growth that stabilizes them.
