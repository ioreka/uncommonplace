Physiologists who scrutinized the structure of the eye described a close resemblance to a lens instrument such as a microscope or telescope. One cannot have a lens instrument without an instrument maker, they argued - a microscope does not put itself together from parts - so likewise, one cannot have an eye without a divine Optician.

When the inventors of modern science banished mysterious agencies from nature to the province of a transcendent God, they predicated their rigorously naturalist approach on a supernatural power. They bequeathed to their heirs a dilemma that remains active over three centuries later. 

Certain verbs, my friend specified, are worse than others: those that seem "anthropomorphizing", such as "want", are only permissible in casual settings. Biologists can say, and allow their docoral students to day, that "cells want to move towards the wound" in conversation but never in print. In contract, other active verbs do not seem anthropomorphizing. The example my friend chose was "regulate": proteins "regulate" cell divisions. She said she does not see this sort of verb as ascribing angency in any bad, anthropomorphizing way - it does not attribute human desires to a cell, for example - but rather as shorthand for a complex process that would be cumbersome to spell out on each occasion and that anyway often contains elements beyond the current reach of biologists' understanding. This sort of active verb is permissible and even widespread in journal articles and textbooks. Proteins "control" chemical reactions; muslce cells "harvest" energy; genes "dictate" the production of enzymes. While [these] do not ascribe human emotions to genes or proteins, they do imply purposeful action.

I think that biologists' figures of speech reflect a deeply-hidden yet abiding quandary created by the seventeenth-century banishment of agency from nature: do the order and action in the natural world originate inside or outside. Either answer raises big problems. Saying "inside" violates the ban on ascriptions of agency to natural phenomena such as cells or molecules, and so risks sounding mystical and magical. Saying "outside" assumes a supernatural source of nature's order, and so violates another scientific principle, the principle of naturalism.

"In German" [Liebniz wrote] "the word for the balance of a clock is Unruhe - which also means disquiet; and one can take that for a model of how it is in our bodies, which can never be perfectly at their ease." As Liebniz saw it, the balance of a clock was in a constant state of agitated motion, and so too were human bodies.

As Liebniz pointed out, if one wanted to disallow appeals to a supernatural god, then a passive clockwork model would not work as a model of living nature. One needed a different model: active, restless clockwork. 

The authors of this thought experiment [the first androids] drew conclusions that were at once physiological, social, moral, economic and political.

[Lamarck's work] this development was the momentous idea that living beings might not just be active but also self-making and self-transforming machines whose structures changed over time.

Intellectual possibilities are not the sole fruits of this investigation, though, nor could they have been, since ideas are inseparable from the world in which they arise.

One major purpose of The Restless Clock has been to demonstrate the importance of historical understanding to current thinking about the sciences of life and mind. Historical analysis, by revealing the now-hidden forces that shaped current scientific problems and principles, can reopen forclosed ways of thinking.

The machine is strikingly persuasive. It seems to suggest that sentience and living agency might just consist of movements of passive mechanical parts. Or else it suggests that mechanical parts are anything but passive. In fact, I think it suggests both things at once. The story lies in the journey to and fro between these possibilities. If aquosity were not a compelling possibility, the joke would not have been funny. 

The Catholic church was the cradle of the clockwork universe and its mechanical inhabitants.

Mechanization has come to be so closely associated with modernization that it is difficult to think one's way back into what automatic machinery might have signified in the late Middle Ages. The major looming obstacle that obstructs the view of the late mediaeval period, as seen from the present, is the Protestant Reformation. The Reformation marked a sea change in the wya people understood the relations between matter and sprit, nature and divinity. Among the many implications of these changed relations - among the less-remarked implications, but important nevertheless - was that machines, and mechanism in general, came to signify something new: an artificial mechanism, composed of material parts, became definitively empty of spirit.

Machinery, that is, could not represent divinity other than deceitfully. 
#anthropocentrism #anthropology 

The lifelike machines [of the late 1680s] appeared neither passive nor rote but full of agency and spirit, though in this case not really divine, but of a decidedly earth sort. From the sublime, onward to the ridiculous. 

The historian Robert Darnton has recommended taking note of the mystifying jokes of the past, as these indicate "where to grasp a foreign system of meaning in order to unravel it".

Rather than to reduce life to mechanism, [Descartes] meant to elevate mechanism to life: to explain life, never to explain it away.

The warm, mobile, responsive machine became still and cold at death, not because the soul left it, but jsut the reverse: in humans, the rational soul departed because the machine stopped working, growing still and cold. 

The tones of an organ, with their unarguably physical nature and origin, provided an apt metaphor for the feelings of Descartes's animal-machine: resonant despite being mechanically produced. 

A single force would therefore move parts with which it was never in direct contact.

This methodological or epistemological revolution, by which I mean a revolution in how people thought they should go about understanding the world, brought with is a profound ontological revolution, by which I mean a revolution in what people thought the world essentially was.

Likewise, in "sensible, living creatures", many different little engines worked together cooperatively, some driving or setting others in motion, some handing off tasks to others, thereby forming one big engine and producing a common result.

Descartes argued that a physical mechanism could never arrange words to as to give meaningful answers to questions. Only a spiritual entity could achieve the limitlessness of interactive language, putting words together in indefinitely many ways.

Jesuit philosophers such as Franciscus Suarez and Franciscus Toletus all agreed that "I am not my soul alone, nor my body alone, but the union."
#duality 

While the rational part of the human soul connected it to the immortal realm of the angels, the vegetative and sensitive parts were what tied it to the corporeal world. 

Having signified beauty, complexity, virtuosity, wisdom, and agency in the ancient and Scholastic intellectual universe, machinery acquired a new set of meanings: passivity, limitation, and constraint. 

Descartes wrote that it was "the soul that senses, and not the body," since when the soul is lost in reverie, the body remains senseless

Only humans too, Hobbes thought, had curiosity, that "lust of the mind ... [that] exceedeth the short vehemence of any carnal pleasure."

Modern science was born, still according to the traditional story, as written by the 17th-century actors themselves, when philosphers such as Descartes, Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, and others insisted that nature be understood not in terms of these mysterious properties, but only in terms of material parts and their movements, as brute machinery. However - and this is one reason why the origin myth of modern science is just that, a mythologized version of events - the model of nature as brute machinery carried a powerful new theology of its own.

Harvey taught his anatomy and surgery students that the brain was a kind of workshop, a "manufatory". Brains produced works of art by bringing an immaterial idea or form to matter. Perhaps a uterus produced an embryo in the same way, by means of a "plastic art" capable of bringing an idea or form to flesh. The form of an embryo existed in the uterus of the mother just as the form off a house existed in the brain o the builder.

Insisting of the inseparability of God from nature, Spinoza argued that with regard to natural phenomena, there could be no external criteria or good or ill. Nature simply _was_.

Liebniz - Since chunks of inert matter, on their own, in his view explained nothing, he replaced extension (size and shape) with perception, and offered an equal and opposite philosophy to Hobbesian materialism: a reduction of matter to spirit. In place of chunks of matter, he put perceiving souls. The building blocks of his cosmos were not blocks but little souls. 
#perception 

Liebniz - no difference in substance, therefore, divided material from spiritual things. 

Being composed o several pieces, a machine "would act diversely, because the particular activity of each piece could at any moment change the course of others." To Bayle, a machine was something made o active parts whose actions generated possibilities.

Living things, Liebniz explained, were more thoroughly mechanical than any artificial device created by human beings. That was because God's machines were irreducibly mechanical down to their "smallest distinguishable parts".

Living machines, that is, creatures, had no true beginnings, apart from the beginning of time, an no real endings: births and deaths were but appearances. Liebniz cited in evidence the transformations revealed by the microscopists whose work he ad studied, which he took to show that animal substance had no beginning. Its apparent generation was "nothing but a development, a sort of augmentation." In reality there was only development and growth, envelopment and diminution. And in this continual waxing and waning, certain souls rose to the degree o reason and to the prerogative of minds.

Mechanical calculators had an analogous effect to the automatic loom, demoting calculation from a paradigm o intelligence to the antithesis of intelligence. If a machine could calculate, then something else - say, decision making or language - must be emblematic of human intelligence.

The Enlightenment man-machine was a great thought experiment, an attempt to reintegrate the human self into the material world, the soul into the machinery. For the first time, people tried to imagine whether a human being could actually be a machine through and through, a purely material set of moving parts, and what that might mean.
#pursuit-of-knowledge 

Frederick II - "He believed he could see clearly that thought is but a consequence of the organization of the machine, and that the disturbance of the springs has considerable influence on that part of us which the metaphysicians call the soul."
