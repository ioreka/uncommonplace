Physiologists who scrutinized the structure of the eye described a close resemblance to a lens instrument such as a microscope or telescope. One cannot have a lens instrument without an instrument maker, they argued - a microscope does not put itself together from parts - so likewise, one cannot have an eye without a divine Optician.

When the inventors of modern science banished mysterious agencies from nature to the province of a transcendent God, they predicated their rigorously naturalist approach on a supernatural power. They bequeathed to their heirs a dilemma that remains active over three centuries later. 

Certain verbs, my friend specified, are worse than others: those that seem "anthropomorphizing", such as "want", are only permissible in casual settings. Biologists can say, and allow their docoral students to day, that "cells want to move towards the wound" in conversation but never in print. In contract, other active verbs do not seem anthropomorphizing. The example my friend chose was "regulate": proteins "regulate" cell divisions. She said she does not see this sort of verb as ascribing angency in any bad, anthropomorphizing way - it does not attribute human desires to a cell, for example - but rather as shorthand for a complex process that would be cumbersome to spell out on each occasion and that anyway often contains elements beyond the current reach of biologists' understanding. This sort of active verb is permissible and even widespread in journal articles and textbooks. Proteins "control" chemical reactions; muslce cells "harvest" energy; genes "dictate" the production of enzymes. While [these] do not ascribe human emotions to genes or proteins, they do imply purposeful action.

I think that biologists' figures of speech reflect a deeply-hidden yet abiding quandary created by the seventeenth-century banishment of agency from nature: do the order and action in the natural world originate inside or outside. Either answer raises big problems. Saying "inside" violates the ban on ascriptions of agency to natural phenomena such as cells or molecules, and so risks sounding mystical and magical. Saying "outside" assumes a supernatural source of nature's order, and so violates another scientific principle, the principle of naturalism.

"In German" [Liebniz wrote] "the word for the balance of a clock is Unruhe - which also means disquiet; and one can take that for a model of how it is in our bodies, which can never be perfectly at their ease." As Liebniz saw it, the balance of a clock was in a constant state of agitated motion, and so too were human bodies. 
#the-body #clocks #humans-and-machines 

As Liebniz pointed out, if one wanted to disallow appeals to a supernatural god, then a passive clockwork model would not work as a model of living nature. One needed a different model: active, restless clockwork. 

The authors of this thought experiment [the first androids] drew conclusions that were at once physiological, social, moral, economic and political.

[Lamarck's work] this development was the momentous idea that living beings might not just be active but also self-making and self-transforming machines whose structures changed over time.

Intellectual possibilities are not the sole fruits of this investigation, though, nor could they have been, since ideas are inseparable from the world in which they arise.

One major purpose of The Restless Clock has been to demonstrate the importance of historical understanding to current thinking about the sciences of life and mind. Historical analysis, by revealing the now-hidden forces that shaped current scientific problems and principles, can reopen forclosed ways of thinking.

The machine is strikingly persuasive. It seems to suggest that sentience and living agency might just consist of movements of passive mechanical parts. Or else it suggests that mechanical parts are anything but passive. In fact, I think it suggests both things at once. The story lies in the journey to and fro between these possibilities. If aquosity were not a compelling possibility, the joke would not have been funny. 

The Catholic church was the cradle of the clockwork universe and its mechanical inhabitants.

Mechanization has come to be so closely associated with modernization that it is difficult to think one's way back into what automatic machinery might have signified in the late Middle Ages. The major looming obstacle that obstructs the view of the late mediaeval period, as seen from the present, is the Protestant Reformation. The Reformation marked a sea change in the wya people understood the relations between matter and sprit, nature and divinity. Among the many implications of these changed relations - among the less-remarked implications, but important nevertheless - was that machines, and mechanism in general, came to signify something new: an artificial mechanism, composed of material parts, became definitively empty of spirit. 
#spirit #soul #cartesian-duality 

Machinery, that is, could not represent divinity other than deceitfully. 
#anthropocentrism #anthropology 

The lifelike machines [of the late 1680s] appeared neither passive nor rote but full of agency and spirit, though in this case not really divine, but of a decidedly earth sort. From the sublime, onward to the ridiculous. 

The historian Robert Darnton has recommended taking note of the mystifying jokes of the past, as these indicate "where to grasp a foreign system of meaning in order to unravel it".

Rather than to reduce life to mechanism, [Descartes] meant to elevate mechanism to life: to explain life, never to explain it away.

The warm, mobile, responsive machine became still and cold at death, not because the soul left it, but jsut the reverse: in humans, the rational soul departed because the machine stopped working, growing still and cold. 

The tones of an organ, with their unarguably physical nature and origin, provided an apt metaphor for the feelings of Descartes's animal-machine: resonant despite being mechanically produced. 

A single force would therefore move parts with which it was never in direct contact.

This methodological or epistemological revolution, by which I mean a revolution in how people thought they should go about understanding the world, brought with is a profound ontological revolution, by which I mean a revolution in what people thought the world essentially was.

Likewise, in "sensible, living creatures", many different little engines worked together cooperatively, some driving or setting others in motion, some handing off tasks to others, thereby forming one big engine and producing a common result. 
#social-contract #organisation #teamwork 

Descartes argued that a physical mechanism could never arrange words to as to give meaningful answers to questions. Only a spiritual entity could achieve the limitlessness of interactive language, putting words together in indefinitely many ways.
#language 

Jesuit philosophers such as Franciscus Suarez and Franciscus Toletus all agreed that "I am not my soul alone, nor my body alone, but the union."
#duality 

While the rational part of the human soul connected it to the immortal realm of the angels, the vegetative and sensitive parts were what tied it to the corporeal world. 

Having signified beauty, complexity, virtuosity, wisdom, and agency in the ancient and Scholastic intellectual universe, machinery acquired a new set of meanings: passivity, limitation, and constraint. 

Descartes wrote that it was "the soul that senses, and not the body," since when the soul is lost in reverie, the body remains senseless

Only humans too, Hobbes thought, had curiosity, that "lust of the mind ... [that] exceedeth the short vehemence of any carnal pleasure."
#pursuit-of-knowledge 

Modern science was born, still according to the traditional story, as written by the 17th-century actors themselves, when philosphers such as Descartes, Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, and others insisted that nature be understood not in terms of these mysterious properties, but only in terms of material parts and their movements, as brute machinery. However - and this is one reason why the origin myth of modern science is just that, a mythologized version of events - the model of nature as brute machinery carried a powerful new theology of its own. 
#religion #faith 

Harvey taught his anatomy and surgery students that the brain was a kind of workshop, a "manufatory". Brains produced works of art by bringing an immaterial idea or form to matter. Perhaps a uterus produced an embryo in the same way, by means of a "plastic art" capable of bringing an idea or form to flesh. The form of an embryo existed in the uterus of the mother just as the form off a house existed in the brain o the builder.

Insisting of the inseparability of God from nature, Spinoza argued that with regard to natural phenomena, there could be no external criteria or good or ill. Nature simply _was_. 
#nature #good-and-evil 

Liebniz - Since chunks of inert matter, on their own, in his view explained nothing, he replaced extension (size and shape) with perception, and offered an equal and opposite philosophy to Hobbesian materialism: a reduction of matter to spirit. In place of chunks of matter, he put perceiving souls. The building blocks of his cosmos were not blocks but little souls. 
#perception 

Liebniz - no difference in substance, therefore, divided material from spiritual things. 

Being composed o several pieces, a machine "would act diversely, because the particular activity of each piece could at any moment change the course of others." To Bayle, a machine was something made o active parts whose actions generated possibilities.
#systems-thinking #consequences 

Living things, Liebniz explained, were more thoroughly mechanical than any artificial device created by human beings. That was because God's machines were irreducibly mechanical down to their "smallest distinguishable parts".

Living machines, that is, creatures, had no true beginnings, apart from the beginning of time, an no real endings: births and deaths were but appearances. Liebniz cited in evidence the transformations revealed by the microscopists whose work he ad studied, which he took to show that animal substance had no beginning. Its apparent generation was "nothing but a development, a sort of augmentation." In reality there was only development and growth, envelopment and diminution. And in this continual waxing and waning, certain souls rose to the degree o reason and to the prerogative of minds.

Mechanical calculators had an analogous effect to the automatic loom, demoting calculation from a paradigm o intelligence to the antithesis of intelligence. If a machine could calculate, then something else - say, decision making or language - must be emblematic of human intelligence.

The Enlightenment man-machine was a great thought experiment, an attempt to reintegrate the human self into the material world, the soul into the machinery. For the first time, people tried to imagine whether a human being could actually be a machine through and through, a purely material set of moving parts, and what that might mean.
#pursuit-of-knowledge 

Frederick II - "He believed he could see clearly that thought is but a consequence of the organization of the machine, and that the disturbance of the springs has considerable influence on that part of us which the metaphysicians call the soul."

"What do we know of our destiny," La Mettrie write, "any more than of our origin?" Human beings, being machines, must accept their "invincible ignorance." He who did so would "wise, just, and tranquil about his fate, and consequently, happy. He will await death neither fearing nor desiring it." Such a creature would cherish life, be "full of respect for Nature; full of gratitude, attachment and tenderness." He would be grateful to partake in the "charming Spectacle of the Universe."

Diderot - "there is only one virtue, justice; one duty, to be happy; one corollary, to overrate life, and not to fear death."

The problem of fragmentation: a dissolution of the human self into the material continuum of nature. If we and the world are all made of a single kind of matter diversely configured, how do we know where one ends and the next begins? Perhaps everything in the material world constitutes just "one great individual." In any machine or animal one can give separate names to the separate parts, Diderot suggested, but that does not make each of these and individual entity. It may make no more sense to identify a person than a bird's wing as an individual.
#individuality #self-and-other #holistic 

Indeed, the nerves of a human being, even those of a philosopher, are but "sensitive vibrating strings," so that the difference between "the philosopher-instrument and the clavichord-instrument" is just the grater sensitivity of the philosopher-instrument and its ability to play itself. 
#self-awareness #reflexive-praxis 

Diderot's "Julie de Lespinasse" character imagines a spider at the center of a web to represent these twin hazards of dissolution and solipsism: losing oneself in the world and losing the world in oneself.
#self 

Without a self, it cannot understand that there is a world outside.

Buffon - When the freeze brought him "perfumes that caused in me an intimate blossoming", these inspired "a sentiment of love for myself."

The defining capacities of a human being, then, according to Buffon's table, were first self-love and second love of others, both residing in the physical manifestiation of touch: the mechanical impact of the creature's parts against one another and against an alien world.
#the-senses 

In other words, like Buffon and many others in this period, Rousseau was ambivalent and inconsistence on the subject of human selfhood and bodily machinery. Sometimes, he defined a human self by its contrast with mechanism, and at other times, he made selfhood a product of the functioning of the body-machine. 

To Buffon, however, as Liebniz had said, a living creature was an organized conglomeration of organized beings, organization all the way down, with an inner self-organizing agency acting at every level. 
#agency 

"Of all the modifications of nature," Bonnet mused, "the most excellent is organization".
#nature #organisation 

Authors of the concept of "organization" generally avoided building metaphors, blocks and stones, in favor of another sort of image: weaving. A living being was not like a wall built of bricks, but rather like a self-moving loom of self-weaving fabric. Bonnet described organized bodies both as "looms" that assimilated and incorporated materials into themselves and also as "cloths, networks, sort of fabrice in which the warp itself forms the woof." Eahc fiber, each "fibrilla", of these loom/fabrics was itself a miniature machine and the "entire machine is in a sense nothing but a repetition of all the machinelets". In fact, an organized body was at once the loom and the fabric, weaving itself such that its parts were themselves self-weaving looms, the whole in constant flux, never remaining the same for a single instant [...] The organic self-weaving agency of living beings extended beyond the individual into its living environment. Bonnet emphasizes that organisims wove themselves from the world around them. Each organized body was a burgeoning mix of all the others. Each was "a little earth, where I perceive in miniature all the species of plants and animals." [...] The each itself, with its air and water and soil, appeared to Bonnet as "but a mass of seeds, a vast organic whole."
#metaphor 

A living, sentient cosmos thrumming with feeling traveled arm in arm with Mr. Machine, a further effect of eliminating Descartes's disjuncture between mechanism and self, self and world.

A remarkable intimacy between poetry and science characterized the Romantic movement.
#multidisciplinary-teams #poetry 

Kant is often described as the first modern philosopher, and like Descartes, he worked at the fault line beween the itnellectual self and the mechanical world, which might suggest that this fault line was itself the starting-point for moden philosophy. 
#philosophy #identity 

Cabanis wrote that the brain was an organ that produced thought just as the stomach digested and the liver filtered bile. 

Rather than contrasting life with nonlife - the inanimate - the Romantics set life up against death. What was not alive was dead.
#life-and-death #duality 

Life was the struggle against extinction, "the sum of the functions that resist death" (Marie-François-Xavier Bichat)

Easmus Darwin: "Organic forms with chemic changes strive,/ Live but to die, and die but to revive."

Not only life but also consciousness and sentience were forms of dynamic participation in the greater life and sentience of nature itself.

Erasmus Darwin: "And what if all of animated nature / Be but organic Harps diversely framed, / That tremble into thought, as o'er them sweeps / Plastic and vast, one intellectual breeze"

The second development was the idea of a kind of transcendence through evergy: the idea that organisms, understood as living machines, were connected through a great web of energy exchange to the cosmos itself. This was an attempt to rescue Frankenstein's monster, made of dead matter, from his terrible isolation without granting him a soul. 
#soul #spirit 

Like the Romantics, Darwin was deeply though fruitfully torn between the mechanist dictate to banish agency from nature and the organicist impulse to naturalize agency, the make agency synonymous with life. His conflicting intellectual inheritances and allegiance put him in a state of profound and extraordinarily productive ambivalence.

Cybernatics was a new field of research and engineering that emerged fully in the wake of WW2, with beginnings stretching back to the late 1910s and '20s. It was devoted to pursuing analogies between living creatures and machines, especially robots. In pursuit of these analogies, the cyberneticists developed new mechanical systems, and also new ways of understanding mechanism, surrounding the key concepts of feedback and self-regulation. #cybernetics 

The czech word robota, which means "drugery" or "servitude". Robotniz is Czech for "self", and the word "robot" in both German and English, before it came to mean robot, referred to a kind of serf specific to central Europe. #linguistic-relativity 

It was Wiener who coined the term "cybernetics" to describe the unified science of homeostatic atifical and organic machinery. Automata, "whether in the metal or in the flesh", must enact a continual exchange with the outside world, and between machine or organisim and environment."

"All purposeful behaviour," the authors maintained, "may be considered to require negative feedback. If the goal is to be attained, some signals from the goal are necessary at some point to direct the behaviour."
#feedback 

Overall, the Homeostat did one things and one thing only, as Ashby himself observed, although he maintained that it did it in "many interesting and intricate ways": it moved "to a state of equilibrium." Its sole purpose and only function was to lapse into inactivity, a curious model for the essence of life and thought. 
#stasis

Turing: infallibility was no requirement for human intelligence. On the contrary, one could make very intelligent and interesting mistakes; indeed, human intelligence developed precisely through such mistakes. 

In other words, intelligence was in the eye of the beholder, unless it was in the private experience of the intelligent being, where it was accessiblt to science. 

Both Turing and the cyberneticists described intelligence as a diachronic phenomenon, occuring in time through learning.

The history of these competing forms of science is profoundly relevant to current debates in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and evolutionary biology.

If computers are intentional, they are so only in virtue of their creators' intentions.

What makes a device or creature smart is not the stuff from which is it made, but the "truth-preserving" arrangements of parts, which in turn stand for elements of the world outside. 

It is often more telling to examine what the two sides of a debate tacitly agree upon than what separates them.

To get beyond the confines of brute mechanism, Schrodinger urged,  "scientific attitude would have to be rebuilt, science must be made anew."
