We humans are rarely good at noticing issues that don't directly affect us.

It didn't make sense to me to choose one culture and force everyone to fit into it. Why give up our cultures when we can share and enjoy many different traditions?

When something does not make sense, I research until it does.

Exclusion robs people of opportunities, and it robs organisations of talent. In the long run, exclusionary systems are lose-lose.

the canary code is a guide to building win-win organisational systems.

There are findings from the autism hiring program at JPMorgan that autistic employees can be up to 140 percent more productive than the average employee. 

In some ways, by trying to counterbalance the "lack of ability" stereotype, the business case created the "superhuman" stereotype - but the everyday humanity of neurodivergent people is lost in the gap between these stereotypes.

The typical set of assumptions on "how to do inclusion" is limiting - and so are the systems based on those assumptions. As long as inclusion is thought of as something slowly doled out by the "born included" based on a limited set of characteristics they choose to include, some people will remain unincludable. Half-measures do not work. Sequential interventions to fix one "ism" without fixing all others leave people out. True inclusion is systemic inclusion.

Finally, inclusion by design must start *from the margin*. Creating systems that remove barriers for the most marginalized and multiply marginalized is the fastest way to remove all barriers. When organizational systems are designed to support the most excluded, removing barriers addresses the specific needs of those groups and supports broader inclusivity. The classic example is curb cuts. Curb cuts, one of the accomplishments of the disability rights movement, remove barriers for wheelchair users. They also make getting around easier for everyone, from parents with strollers to delivery people with heavy loads.
Consulting the most marginalized among us about what would be helpful for them is likely to lead to innovative solutions and a more human0centric design for all. In the context of neurodiversity, optimizing the environment for neurodivergent people by providing flexible schedules, quieter workplaces, lower stress, clear communication, and training designed fr a broader range of learning needs - the psychological curb cut effect - will create an environment where everyone can thrive. The air quality that keeps canaries healthy will keep everyone healthy. And that is the essence of the Canary Code.

For example, the Te Reo Hapai word for ADHD is *aroreretini* - "attention goes to many things". Compare the meaning of "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder" with "attention goes to many things". In many situations, such as when looking for food sources in the wild or working in a busy ER, attention to many things can be a benefit - not a deficit or a disorder. This word is an example of both a more accurate and intentionally nonstigmatizing, nonjudgemental language.
*Aroreretini* may not be a perfect word - it is not possible to capture the many manifestations of ADHD and the unique forms it can take in every individual. But a nondeficit perspective is a major departure from the traditional medical approach.

Still, I find these terms irresistibly beautiful. They are examples of looking at differences in human psychological functioning as just that - differences, rather than deficiencies or pathologies. And that is the very heart of the neurodiversity approach.
#neurodivergence 

"If neurodiversity applies to everyone, is anyone at all neurotypical?"
There are some who believe that neurotypical does not exist - that everyone is in some way neurodivergent. However, according to autistic psychologist and thought leader Nick Walker, this argument stems from the false assumption that "neurotypical is just a synonym for normal". The belief in "normal" minds and brains is associated with the medical/pathology paradigm and does not make sense from the neurodiversity perspective. "Neurotypicality" is socially and culturally constructed. Dominant cultures operating within the "normal" versus "pathological" paradigm create cultural expectations of normativity: hence, children and adults are repeatedly told to "act normal" and not be "weird". 

For example, in many modern cultures, teenagers are expected to enjoy dance parties, and adults are expected to enjoy lively lunches with colleagues. Those are "things to do." Both of these things are also stimulating. However, optimizing the functioning of some peoples' nervous systems requires relaxation, not revving up. Research indicates the brains of autistic youth at rest produce 42% more information than the average. This elevated resting state results in higher neurological excitation for autistic youths compared to allistics exposed to the same stimulation and likely triggers the need for protective withdrawal. Thus, some nervous systems are more easily overwhelmed with additional external stimuli.

Neuronormative work expectations, however, are often concerned with neuronormative performance more than with objective outcome performance. Most workplaces have an expectation of lunchtime socializing. For me, that usually meant a choice between experiencing the sensory overwhelm of lunch in a bust cafeteria and the resulting shutdown, or being able to do the "Work work" in the afternoon. After trying for some time, I largely chose to work and take walks instead of socializing. The penalty was the loss of neurotypical privilege of access to organizational power.
#power 

The "neurotypical brain" may not exist, but the neurotypical privilege of confirming to neuronormative expectations without making oneself sick certainly does.
#privilege 

As another example, in search of productivity advantages, many people seek focus gurus to help them get into flow or hyperfocus. However, in autistics and ADHDers, hyperfocus is seen as a deficit and a symptom of the disorder in need of correction. This is the essence of the medical model and its biasing impact on thinking. Without an "autism" or "ADHD" label, hyperfocus is framed as a highly desired state of flow, associated with people working on tasks that interest them with a level of challenge that is just right - stretching, yet within reach. With a label attached, however, the flow becomes a flaw - something to break rather than nurture.
#relative-correctness 

Neurodiversity is sometimes referred to as cognitive diversity, brain differences, or information-processing differences. But that is a limiting definition, especially if by "cognitive" we only mean thought patterns, ideas, problem-solving methods, and intellectual perspectives - mental manifestations that can be explained in words or diagrams. Neurodiversity also encompasses our emotions and our bodies, which are intertwined.

Entitlements should end where harm to others begins. Organizations are responsible for developing mechanisms that maximally prevent and address harm to employee well-being caused to other employees or customers.

Humans experience the world through their senses. We rely on them to navigate our environments, receive information, and interact with others. However, traditional workplace design often fails to account for the diversity of sensory needs. This can lead to discomfrt, distraction, illness, injuries, exclusion, and disabling, in the sense of the social model of disability, for those who do not fit the "norm".

We can't belong if we are not being believed.

Lighting, noise, temperature, and smell greatly affect our ability to focus and think, our emotions, productivity, and well-being. Because of a heightened sensitivity, an inability to filter sensory stimuli, a more intense reaction to stimuli, or all of the above, neurodivergent people can even become physically ill in response to environments that others may not find particularly aversive. 

Inclusion must encompass all signals an organization sends out, not just symbolic ones. Mixed signals do not work.

Creating environments for belonging requires developing systems that are deeply and holistically inclusive - in ways that people can experience and sense with their entire being.

With sequential inclusion approaches, intersectionally marginalized people may remain unincludable for a lifetime.

Sequential inclusion that is slowly expanded from the circle of power out does not work.

"Special needs" - like the prevention of unnecessary anxiety and the provision of flexible support - are in fact human needs, at any age. And perhaps neurodivergent people are "not the only ones who've been misunderstood and mistreated all this time... They're just the ones who feel it most, the ones who finally got the message through to the rest of humanity that there's a better way to be."

Like canaries in the coal mine, neurodivergent people are the first to feel the mistreatment and effects of poorly designed systems, whether at school or work. A systemic approach to improvement is essential because fixing just one negative workplace factor, be it the inaccessible, stress-inducing design of physical work environments of a lack of flexibility, will not be enough. But fixing _all_ these factors will make a difference not just for neurodivergent people but for many others. Fixing unwelcome spaces supports disability inclusion and is enjoyed by all. And flexible work supports caregivers, working students, and many others.

Sometimes providing the flexibility that neurodivergent employees need is approaches as an issue of accommodations. Accommodations certainly help, but they also have two important drawbacks.
1. Accommodations often require disclosure and documentation. Not everyone is comfortable disclosing or even providing the requested documentation, however. Disclosure can result in discrimination, and for many, healthcare options are limited.
2. Accommodations for nonapparent disabilities, such as flexible schedules or working from home, are desired by most employees and may result in envy and bullying from coworkers who see accommodations as privileges.
Making flexibility a rule rather than an exception addresses the problems of disclosure, discrimination, and bullying. It also helps support all employees with a wide range of needs.

Workplace justice comes in several forms. Early research focused on the fairness of outcomes (_distributive_ justice, such as fair hiring decisions) and procedures (_procedural_ justice). Leventhal's six procedural justice criteria can also be used as a checklist for key inclusion practices in the workplace. Just procedures should meet the following criteria:
1. Consistent application across individuals and time
2. Absence of bias
3. Accurate information as a foundation of decision-making
4. Mechanism to revise incorrect decisions
5. Adherence to ethical standards
6. Inclusion of the perspectives of various groups affected by the decisions
Later models added considerations of interpersonal treatment, dignity, and providing sufficient information to employees (_interpersonal_ and _informational_ justice). The most recent addition is _contributive_ justice; opportunities for employees to fully and meaningfully participate at work, which can increase the sense of belonging. All types of justice affect employee well-being, morale, and, ultimately, the sense of belonging in the organization.

Traditional job interviews are meant to assess the employee's potential to do the job. Unfortunately, they often assess the mastery of small talk, charisma, and the similarity with the interviewer. Not great for expanding diversity and often exclusionary for autistic candidates.

The job analysis must be examined to ensure inclusivity. It should account for the fact that employees from different demographic groups may experience the same job differently and that employees with different abilities can perform the same job in dissimilar but equally effective ways. 

Here's an example using typically available data to train automated systems. Imagine that we are predicting the success of individuals in doing cooking tasks. We give them all an opportunity to cook in a kitchen and measure their speed and accuracy in the food prep. Sounds fair, right?
On further examination, let's say the kitchen is built for people who are around 5.5 feet (168cm) tall with no disabilities. We use that same kitchen to test the success of everyone: average-height people, those who are 4 fee tall, those who are 7 feet tall, and wheelchair users. Although the people who do not "fit" the kitchen show incredible ingenuity to accomplish their task, their success requires extra time and effort. Very few pass the test and are hired. Even fewer become master chefs. Over time, we have enough data to justify that being 5.5 feet tall is a valid predictor of a chef's success. Which it is - _but only because the kitchen is built for these people_.
Should we continue hiring 5.5 feet tall chefs, allowing the automated screening to exclude applicants who don't meet the height requirement because it is technically "predictive"? Or should we make kitchens more flexible and accessible and avoid automatically screening out a wider pool of applicants?
By the same logic, what makes more sense: Should organizations continue to exclude neurodivergent people based on the data that come from exclusionary environments? Or should we make organizations neuroinclusive and collect better data?
#data 

Workplaces need all kinds of minds, and delection systems should be fair and valid for all kinds of minds. Often, making systems fair requires a commitment to continuous improvement and the participation of those the system has previously not served well.

Temple Grandin: "Highly specialized work calls for highly specialized minds. For these programs to work, we need to understand that accommodations are not special favors"

Money can buffer some of the challenges of neurodivergence, and neurotypicality can make poverty a little less painful. Conversely, disadvantages stack up and beget more disadvantages. This is why inclusion must also be intersectional.

Onboarding is the process of integrating a new employee into an organisation. It is much more than new employee orientation.
#work 

A significant challenge faced by many neurodivergent individuals is the nonapparent nature of their struggles and disabilities. This invisibility often leads to misconceptions and judgements about the need for and validity of accommodations/adjustments. 

The pandemic exposed the charade of the fake scarcity surrounding flexibility.

Inclusion means it is truly ok to close one's office door, work from the focus room on site, or work from home without missing the watercooler wages or proximity perks. Otherwise, disabled employees, neurodivergent employees, and solo caregivers contributing from home are, at best, "included-ish" but not really included.

Productivity is not about getting more done in less time. It's about getting the work that matters done well, in a minimal amount of time without sacrificing value and quality. To support true productivity, many organizations may need to move away from the cultures of "looking busy" and embrace outcomes-based work. This transition will liekly require training managers and supervisors in outcomes-focused ways of thinking and working.

In other situations, a teamwork approach simply does not fit the task, and the work could be better handled individually. Teamwork is a fine hammer, but not every project is a nail.
#teamwork 

One of the pernicious myths used as an excuse for workplace exclusion of autistic people is that they are "not team players". In fact, autistic people can and do collaborate. However, it is important that collaborations and teamwork are meaningful, well organized, and equitable.
#autism 

Increasingly, teamwork doesn't mean brainstorming face-to-face or even working simultaneously in the same space. Virtual collaborations create new opportunities for meaningful participation. Brainwriting and other forms of asynchronous ideation have been shown to be more inclusive, because they allow more people to express themselves. They are also more likely to produce more creative ideas because domineering personalities are not able to talk over quieter thinkers or culturally modest people.

Ensuring transparency and developing systems for procedural justice can help support equity and inclusion on the organizational level, even if unconscious biases are present to some extent on the individual level.
#bias 

The practice of encouraging competition misses the critical distinction between routine physical tasks and novel intellectual tasks of knowledge work. Unlike physical contests such as sports, complex intellectual work suffers under scrutiny, constant evaluation, and the pressure of competition.

Human-centric managers seek employee input on job duties, performance goals, perceived wins and obstacles, and desired development opportunities. Job crafting to develop job roles, responsibilities, and career paths that align with employees' interests in more likely to improve engagement and job satisfaction. 

The "tightrope" metaphor refers to the narrow range of behavior seen by society as acceptable for people from nondominant and stigmatized groups. Meanwhile, those from dominant groups enjoy much more leeway. For example, women in leadership are expected to be "strong" but never "aggressive". Women walk the tightrope because the range of expected behavior is almost impossibly narrow.

_Benevolent ablesim_ is a patronizing, infantilizing attitude parallel to benevolent sexism that prevents employees from fully exercising their abilities under the guide of protection. 

After trying the usual methods - training people to give and receive feedback - Ultranauts decided there was no "one size fits all" approach. They added a question about preferences to their biodex - the individual "user manual" all employees fill out. As expected, there was a great range of preferences. Some wanted the feedback immediately, others at the end of the day, or at the end of the week so they would have a chance to recover. Some wanted it in conversation, some via email. Tailoring the feedback delivery to each individual was the solution that worked, and satisfaction with the ongoing feedback increased from 60 to 80 percent.

Cultures manifest through collective habits. Organizations that collectively implement these steps and integrate perspective-taking into daily practices and organizational habits can create a culture of improved understanding, collaboration, and flexibility. However, although organizational-level commitment to a culture of perspective-taking is my ideal, individual managers can make a difference in their units even if that higher-level change has not yet happened. Better still, making a difference and caring do not have to mean working harder.

Leaders carry a major responsibility for the well-being of their employees - neurodivergent or neurotypical. Leadership requires perspective-taking and understanding just how much power they have over their employees' lives. A 2023 study indicated that managers influence employee mental health as much as spouses. Leadership practices have a major impact on the psychological climate, morale, trust, and inclusive practices in organizations.
#trust #leadership 

The leadership literature is immense. Over the years, there has been an avalanche in research and writing on leadership. In 1960, there were 499 peer-reviewed papers about leadership styles. In 2017, there were 31,339. In 2023, there were 53,221.

Expecting to encounter cultural differences can help people interpret differences through a cultural lens. Understanding neurodivergence as a culture can help managers, colleagues, and employees and neurodivergent people let go of the expectation of neuronormative sameness. Instead, it can facilitate an open-minded anticipation of differences that often occurs in cross-cultural interactions.

If there is more than one way to be a leader, then why do most organizations worldwide have only one leadership pathway? Why are people with great strategic minds told they are "not leadership material" just because they find small talk draining?

Standardized career paths intended to shape the "ideal company person" fail to maximise the potential of employees' unique talents and unique minds. Unlocking the full potential of those who are energized by people, systems, strategy, or ideas requires different growth paths. It requires different ways to climb toward different talent "peaks" of our spiky profiles.

A _thought leadership_ focus might be idea for employees who love solving puzzles applicable outside the organization. These people excel in conceptual thinking, research, finding innovative solutions to wicked problems, and communicating these solutions in an innovative and influential way. Often, this type of talent "outgrows" development opportunities offered by organizations and exits.

In Jerry's words, "many people will assume you are "less" because you are neurodivergent. In my experience, most people who are neurotypical, whether they are leaders or employees, automatically assume they are superior to those of us who are not."

Ben Gorissen also believes that in some ways, his autistic traits make him a more effective leader: "Because of my personal need for order, I have always been keen to put structure in place when I started a new role. This has helped me create focus and clarity for others as well, making me a more effective leader and colleague."

Social psychologists John French and Bertram Raven described five bases of interpersonal power, or the ability to affect change, back in 1959. They disagreed on the sixth - informational power.

Working with neurodivergent people requires adjusting mental models that do not take into account spiky ability profiles. When someone classified as an "achiever" struggles, do not assume they are being lazy or difficult on purpose. It is important to remember to control bias and to support neurodivergent performers in working with their strengths.
