Every generation since about 1830 has had to fight its version of the beauty myth.

The beauty myth tells a story: The quality called "beauty" objectively and universally exists. Women must want to embody it and men must want to possess women who embody it. This embodiment is an imperative for women and not for men, which situation is necessary and natural because it is biological, sexual, and evolutionary: Strong men battle for beautiful women, and beautiful women are more reproductively successful. Women's beauty must correlate on their fertility, and since this system is based on sexual selection, it is inevitable and changeless. 
None of this is true. "Beauty" is a currency system like the gold standard. Like any economy, it is determined by politics, and in the modern age in the West it is the last, best belief system that keeps male dominance intact. In assigning value to women in a vertical hierarchy according to a culturally imposed physical standard, it is an expression of power relations in which women must unnaturally compete for resources that men have appropriated for themselves.

There is no legitimate historical or biological justification for the beauty myth.

If the beauty myth is not based on evolution, sex, gender, aesthetics, or God, on what is it based? It claims to be about intimacy and sex and life, a celebration of women. It is actually composed of emotional distance, politics, finance, and sexual repression. The beauty myth is not about women at all. It is about men's institutions and institutional power.

And the unconscious hallucination grows ever more influential and pervasive because of what is now conscious market manipulation: powerful industries - the $33-billion-a-year diet industry, the $20-billion cosmetics industry, the $300-million cosmetic surgery industry, and the $7-billion pornography industry - have arisen from the capital made out of unconscious anxieties, and are in turn able, through their influence on mass culture, to use, stimulate, and reinforce the hallucination in a rising economic spiral.

According to the Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs: "While women represent 50% of the world population, they perform nearly two-thirds of all working hours, receive only one-tenth of the world income and own less than 1 percent of the world property." The "Report on the World Conference for the United Nations Decade for Women" agrees: When housework is accounted for, "women around the world end up working twice as many hours as men."

Women of all classes know that considered ugly and punished accordingly.

If a single standard were applied equally to men as to women in TV journalism, most of the men would be unemployed. 

Her account proves how this discrimination seeps in where others cannot read, poisoning the private well from which self esteem is drawn.

Male culture seems happiest to imagine two women together when they are defined as being one winner and one loser in the beauty myth.

A women's magazine is not just a magazine. The relationship between the woman reader and her magazine is so different from that between a man and his that they aren't in the same category.

The magazines provide actual services, listing help lines, offering readers' polls, giving women tools for budgeting and financial information,. These combine to make the magazine seem to be more than a magazine: They make it appear to be a mix of extended family, benefit agency, political party, and guild. They make it look like an interest group with the reader's best interests at heart. "A magazine," says one editor, "is like a club. Its function is to provide readers with a comfortable sense of community and pride in their identity."

This issue is not trivial. It is about the most fundamental freedoms: the freedom to imagine one's own future and to be proud of one's own life. Airbrushing age off women's faces has the same political echo that would resound if all positive images of blacks were routinely lightened. That would be making the same value judgement about blackness that this tampering makes about the value of the female life: that less is more. To airbrush age off a woman's face is to erase women's identity, power, and history.

Magazines, consciously or half-consicously, must project the attitude that looking one's age is bad because $650 million of their ad revenue comes from people who would go out of business if visible age looked good.

To understand the primal force of this religion, we need to see that men die once and women die twice. Women die as beauties before their bodies die.

In New York subways, metropolitan policemen confiscated handmade anti-AIDS posters that showed illiterate people how to put a condom over an erect penis; they left the adjacent ads for _Penthouse_, displayed by the New York City Transit Authority, intact. Leaving aside the issue of what violent sexual imagery does, it is still apparent that there is an officially endorsed double standard for men's and women's nakedness in mainstream culture that bolsters power inequalities.

To live in a culture in which women are routinely naked where men aren't is to learn inequality in little ways all day long. So even if we agree that sexual imagery is in fact a language, it is clearly on that is already heavily edited to protect men's sexual - and hence social - confidence while undermining that of women.

If a woman loves her own body, she doesn't grudge what other women do with theirs; if she loves femaleness, she champions its rights. It's true what they say about women: Women _are_ insatiable. We _are_ greedy. Our appetites do need to be controlled if things are to stay in place. If the world were ours too, if we believed we could get away with it, we _would_ ask for more love, more sex, more money, more commitment to children, more food, more care. These sexual, emotional, and physical demands _would_ begin to extend to social demands: payment for care of the elderly, parental leave, childcare, etc. The force of female desire would be so great that society would truly have to reckon with what women want, in bed and in the world.
