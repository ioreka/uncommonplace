Craft forms a triumvirate with art and design, each overlapping into the other like a three-set Venn diagram. There is nothing new in this blurring of the boundaries. Craft and design are an essential part of the language of the decorative arts; it is only in recent decades that each dialect has splintered off into its own region.

Craft is often defined as the skill of making something by hand, but if the resulting object is a dry-stone wall on a Derbyshire dale, it is perceived as something quite different from a hand-blown glass vessel in an international art fair. Both are craft, but one is seen as purely functional, whereas the other is seen as akin to fine art. If a table is made by a local carpenter, it is craft. It is it made in a workshop headed by a designer-artist (who may or may not be personally involved with its making), it is perceived as a piece of custom design. The fact is that - like art - craft is a word that people use in different contexts to mean different things to different people. Our own view is that it is all valid and valuable; that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

Within these pages, we have tried to bring together all aspects of craft from traditional, heritage skills to the most contemporary and collectible examples; from makers with decades of experience to those who have only recently discovered that using the hands quietens the mind and frees the spirit.

The post-War industrialised world may have driven a wedge between us and the natural, human process of making, but we can learn from the past, recognising that skills which harness the mind, imagination, hand and eyes are as relevant and important to our future as ever before.
