Consumers understand that cheddar isn't simply cheese, said the consultant. There's "artisinal cheddar, Cabot cheddar, Velveeta, or a plastic block painted to look like cheese." Unwittingly, patients face similar choices about quality every time they go to a drugstore. yet because they have no idea such distictions exist, they have no way to request one drug that is better than the next. Patients implicitly trust the FDA to ensure the high quality of their medicine. As a result, most patients do more due diligence when they change their cell phone provider or buy a car, yet will walk into CVS "and not think for one second about what they put in their mouth that could kill them," a lawyer who represented a pharmaceutical whistleblower told me.

As Kevin Kolar, formerly Mylan's vice president of technical support, explained, a finished drug cannot be separated from the data created in the process of making it. "One without the other is not a product... If it's not documented, it didn't happen. Meticulous attention to detail. That's your business, your entire business."

In the decades-long journey to improve quality, the pivotal shift was from product to process. No longer could drug makers simply wait until after a drug was made to test for passing results, a hallmark of bad manufacturing. Perhaps at the end, you could test a few pills from a batch, but a million pills? That was impossible. Quality had to be built into the process, by documenting and testing each result along the way. 
This process, known as "process validation", gained currency in the late 1980s.

Though his father left the family with no savings, he had "wealth of character", Beato recalled. Hundreds of his grateful patients turned out for the wake, proof that his father had lived a meaningful life dedicated to helping others.

Suketu Mehta - "You have to break the law to survive... I dislike giving bribes, I dislike buying movie tickets in black [illegally]. But since the legal option is so ridiculously arduous - in getting a driving licence, in buying a movie ticket - I take the easy way out. If a whole country collectively takes the easy way out, an alternative system is established whose rules are more or less known to all, whose rates are fixed. The "parallel economy", a travelling partner of the official economy, is always there, turn your head a little to the left or the right and you'll see it."

Ultimately, the project culminated in nine major reports, most of which blamed three factors typically associated with drug resistance: pullotion from drug manufacturing in developing countries, which spews medicine into lakes and rivers; the widespread overuse of antibiotics in livestock; and medication misuse, when patients don't take their medicine exactly as prescribed. But one of those reports blamed a fourth factor: substandard generics that are systematically underdosing wide populations in the developing world.

Bright Simons: "All medicines are poisonous. It's only under the most controlled conditions that they do good."

In theory, it shouldn't have mattered whether US regulators announced their inspections in advance or not. Drug manufacturers are supposed to follow good manufacturing processes ALL THE TIME. Well-run plants operate in a state of continuous regulatory readiness. Compliance isn't a part time thing.

The FDA's investigators had been trained for a different era, when the data printed out on paper was the only data that existed. The agency had not significantly rethought or overhauled its training program is decades. As one FDA consultant put it, "People are using brains from 1990 to do their thinking" today.

Investigative journalism can be a difficult line of work. You must relinquish assumptions, investigate with an open mind, follow facts wherever they lead, and puta human face on the findings. If successful, the effort can galvanize public opinion and ultimately lead to reforms. But there is a paradox at the core of investigative journalism: in order to create positive change, you must often expose very bad news.
