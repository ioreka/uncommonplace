In the south-west of England alone, the annual turnover of agriculture is more than Â£2.7 billion -more than any other region. Bidding farewell to 92% of regional culm grassland (tussocky, moist, generally fabulous) by merging fields and eradicating natural buffers over the past 100 years has removed a vital climate change ally from South West geography. Culm grassland stores more than 5 times more water than monoculture grassland - as well as filtering it, reducing downstream flood risk and improving water quality. There's also the bonus that the topsoil beneath tussocks stores twice as much carbon as intensively managed farmland. And although 25% of England's SSSIs are in the south west, nearly all of these sensitive areas (including Dartmoor and Exmoor National Park) are farmed.

Rachel Jones, snr ecologist for Butterfly Conservation: "parasitism is _only_ a problem if the habitat doesn't have enough of a network to support such complex dynamics - it's a really important part of a robust ecological network."

It's that classic predatory/prey anecdote where each species is other other's alibi for life. No amount of data can determine what will happen to this unique, co-evolved dynamic in a warmer world. Contemplating what might happen does, however, bring forth a glaringly obvious conclusion: that nature is a lot more bloody complicated than we thought.

There is no oak without acorns. No sunday roast without pollinators. Less air for us to breathe without plankton.

These things are all tangible, physical, within reach. What sickens me is that we are more likely to see a harbour porpoise emaciated in a fishing net than we are to see its dance with the waves.

Until I wrote this book, I was among the millions who were unaware of the submerged meadows that border the coastline of the British Isles, let alone remotely awake to its importance and plight. Foxes were braver. Orcas felt bigger. Woodland, more tangible. But, the very idea of submerged meadows that annually flower and go to seed summer after summer, that have teams of crustacean pollinators and that house an entire world of dependent life, soon reeled me in hook, line and sinker. Some meadows are so vast they could cover more than 40,000 rugby pitches. 

Looking back, I think swimming among seagrass could rank in the top 5 of the great human experiences. We forget the tender joy the natural world can elicit. Its raw force muffled under a duvet of digital distraction. The beauty of searching for a plant is it involves no spectacular chase. Rarely does it require hours of boredom in a hide and a rediscovery of how fascinating one's fingernails are. Plants don't try and outwit you. They are just there.

I read somewhere that a common misconception about a tree's root system is that it mirrors the trunk and branches above. In reality, roots are surprisingly shallow, dominating only the upper 60cm of soil, instead opting for a widespread approach - fingers in lots of pies. 

There is undeniable appeal in abandoning the frustration of formal environmental decisions and just cracking on with the job yourself. 

Yet if the melody of the sea is to be truly resolved, human community must be at the heart of the song.

As a group of animals, bats have outlived people around 250 times over, Earth being their rightful pad for more than 50 million years. around 1400 bat species have emerged during that time, making bats the second largest group of mammals after rodents, comprising about 20% of all mammals. It's easy to overlook that bats remain the only mammal that has ever evolved full flight, already achieving what we never will.

It's to be expected that humans would look to the natural world for a little inspiration. After all, most plants and animals have spent a bit more time on earth - innovating and finding solutions. From Chinese inventor Lu Ban observing how lotus leaves deflect heavy rain to Da Vinci's flying machines and a kingfisher's dive teaching Japanese bullet trains to fillet the wind, the umbrella, the plane and the train have enabled humans to progress at astonishing speeds.

Jack told me how new evidence is emerging on some bats, finding how they can form friendships across species and actively travel further to maintain them - for years.

Like orchards, seabirds have good and bad years, governed by many variables.

I would go so far as to say we don't give many seabirds more than a passing thought, despite the fact that they are possibly the most accessible link we have between land and sea.

Yes, renewable energy represents an essential step towards damning fossil fuels to the history books, but it could also herald a significant human-wildlife conflict.

We have the most diverse range of kept species in Europe, spread across nearly twice the area of our terrestrial woodland.

Kelp beds function as a vital corridor that connects land and sea via seabirds. "Many birds... bring nutrients back from the sea that otherwise wouldn't make it onto land." rory

Rewilding is often misunderstood as the process of returning a landscape to its raw, natural form. Unfortunately, humans have already toyed so much with the land that the past is out of reach. ... Rewilding describes the process of allowing nature to have more of a say in how the land answers to change within the boundaries that remain.

"If dung is left on its own, it undergoes anaerobic respiration of microbes, which does not end well" --> Darren. Pasture fouling, where dung is left unchanged on the pasture. Not only does this lock up nutrients, but it also kills the grass below. Bad news for crops and livestock alike. "But get beetles in there doing their thing, and this buries the dung in the soil, opening it up to other insects that will continue to decompose it. This "bioturbation" adds nitrogen and phosphates to the soil, enriching its composition and increasing grass growth. Once the dung is in the soil, rove beetles arrive, feasting on fly larvae and eggs. And then the worms come. They, too, smell the new dung, taking sections the beetles have perforated and tugging it further down on a deeper journey into the soil. These successional waves of invertebrates mean that, in theory, one field with a few healthy cattle could constitute an entire archipelago of life.

Penny: a single pat with its city of insects could attract jackdaws, long-eared bats, horseshoe bats, owls and many other species, all of which want, and need, a slice of the action. Even the white storks - reborn in a landmark project within Knepp after hundreds of years and how free-flying - feed directly on the dung beetles themselves. Beetles offer all of this rent-free. What noble and helpful tenants.

According to the United Nations, the global population of livestock surpasses the transportation industry in the emission of greenhouse gases.

Darren: "if you only have cattle in the landscape, you'll oust smaller dung-feeding beetles. If you only have deer, you'll miss out on the big ones. You need a mosaic of dung to facilitate the whole system."

Ah, _The System_. Always acknowledged with such reverence among conservationists as if we truly know what it means.

A survey in 2020 found _every single_ English river (all 1500 of them!) failed water quality tests - just 14% were of 'good' ecological standard. Yet as a write this in 2021, a new report from charity Surfers against Sewage found that incidences of sewage discharge in UK waterways have risen by nearly 88% since then.

" we don't need to manage salmon", Janina Gray reminded me, "they are incredibly adaptable if given a chance. We need to manage ourselves and our impacts on the aquatic environment - to allow them the strongest chance to survive."

More than half of Scotland is owned by just 500 people, representing possibly the most blatantly unequal land ownership of any modern nation in the world.

UK skies hold 40 million fewer birds than they did only 30 years ago.
40 million birds gone - within my lifetime.

What's bizarre is that bumblebees are warm-blooded, just like us. 

One of the earliest flowering plants, magnolias likely triggered the birth of insect pollination millions of years ago. Since then, evolution has fine-tuned the strings that pull it together, resulting in the most astonishing harmony.

In 2013, Professor Daniels Robert led an extraordinary piece of research while I was at uni in Bristol, which discovered for the first time that flowers could communicate to bees via electrical signals. Emitting weak, negatively charged electrical fields towards a bee's weak positive charge establishes a line of electrical communication lasting several minutes. What they talk about in those few minutes is surely the ultimate cipher. How many other Enigma codes are waiting to be broken? 

I'm worried that we risk making a mockery of bumblebees. We are blithely overusing their looks as though they are ornaments of the countryside rather than a cornerstone of it.
