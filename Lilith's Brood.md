"And you think destroying what was left of our cultures will make us better?"
"No. Only different."

"You are intelligent," he said. "That's the newer of the two characteristics, and the one you might have put to work to save yourselves. You are potentially one of the most intelligent species we've found, though your focus is different from ours. Still, you had a good start in the life sciences, and even in genetics."
"What's the second characteristic?"
"You are hierarchical. That's the older and more entrenched characteristic. We saw it in your closest animal relatives and in your most distant ones. It's a terrestrial characteristic. When human intelligence served it instead of guiding it, when human intelligence did not even acknowledge it as a problem, but took pride in it or did not notice it at all..." The rattling sounded again. "That was like ignoring cancer. I think your people did not realize what a dangerous thing they were doing."

She had learned to keep her sanity by accepting things as she found them, adapting herself to new circumstances by putting aside the old ones whose memories might overwhelm her.

"How many times can you have everyone taken from you and still have the will to start again?" Tate muttered.
As many times as it took, Lilith thought wearily.

Humans were a compelling, seductive, deadly contradiction.

"Human diversity is fascinating and seductive, but we can't let it destroy them - or us."

"It's primitive! You live like savages! I mean..." He lowered his voice. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that. It's just that... I don't know any polite way to ask this: Why don't you at least built real houses and get rid of these shacks! You should see what we have! And... Hell, you have spaceships. How can you live this way!"

"Our kids will be okay," she said. "But I wish we could get more of your people to come here. They're as close to immortal as a Human being has ever been, and all they can think of to do is build useless houses and kill one another."

He thought he understood anger, hatred, humiliation, even the desire to kill a man. He had felt all those things. But to kill everyone... almost to kill the Earth... There were times when he wondered if somehow the Oankali had not caused the war for their own purposes. How could sane people like the ones he had left behind in Phoenix do such a thing - or, how could they let insane people gain control of devices that could do so much harm? If you knew a man was out of his mind, you restrained him. You didn't give him power.

"What can you do with a beautiful woman that you can't do with an ugly one? Nothing. It's just a matter of preference."

"What can I take back that will grow?" Gabe would say. He could now know how much this pelased Akin. What he and Gabe were doing was what the Oankali always did - collect life, travel and collect and itnegrate new life into their ships, their already vast collection of living things, and themselves.

Akin touched her face so that she would open her eyes. Humans seemed almost not to be there when they closed their eyes.

Helpless lust and unreasoning anxiety were just part of growing up.

"Nothing is more tenacious than the life we are made of. A world of life from apparent death, from dissolution. That's what we believe in."
