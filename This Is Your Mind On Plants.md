Of all the many things humans rely on plants for - sustenance, beauty, medicine, fragrance, flavor, fiber - sure the most curious is our use of them to chance consicousness.

One of the innumerable threads connecting us to the natural world is the one that links plant chemistries to human consciousness.

Once humans discovered what caffeine and morphine and mescaline could do for them, the plants that produce the greatest amounts of these chemicals were the ones that prospered in the sunshine of our attention; we disseminated their genes around the world, vastly expanding their habitat and providing for their every need. By now our fates and the fates of these plants are complexly intertwined. What began as war has evolved into marriage.

But the blunt instrument of a drug war has kept us from reckoning with these ambiguities and the important questions about our nature that they raise. The drug war's simplistic account of what drugs do and are, as well as its insistence on lumping them all together under a single meaningless rubric, has for too long prevented us from thinking clearly about the meaning and potential of these very different substances. The legal status of this or that molecule is the one of the least interesting things about it. Much like a food, a psychoactive drug is not a thing - without a human brain, it is inert - so much as it is a relationship; it takes both a molecule and a mind to make anything happen.

Humans have been cultivating opium poppies for more than five thousand years, as one of the most important medicines in the pharmacopoeia. 

you see, I'd become curious as to whether it was in fact possible, as I'd recently read, for a gardener of average skills to obtain a narcotic from a plant grown in this country from legally available seeds. To another gardener this will not seem odd, for we gardeners are like that: eager to try the improbable, to see if we can't successfully grow an artichoke in Zone 5 or make echinacea tea from the roots of our purple coneflowers. Deep down I suspect that many gardeners regard themselves as minor-league alchemists, transforming the dross of compost (and water and sunlight) into substances of rare value and beauty and power.

The war on drugs is in truth a war on _some_ drugs, their enemy status the result of historical accident, cultural prejudice, and institutional imperative. The taxonomy on behalf of which this war is being fought would difficult to explain to an extra-terrestrial.

Caffeine is one of the most studied psychoactive compounds there is.

Something like 90% of humans ingest caffeine regularly, making it the most widely used psychoactive drug in the world, and the only one we routinely give to children (commonly in the form of soda). Few of us even think of it as a drug, much less our daily use of it as an addiction.

That's pretty much all writers do: take the blooming multiplicity of the world and our experience of it, _literally_ concentrate it down to manageable proportions, and then force it through the eye of a grammatical needle one word at a time.

I came to see how integral caffeine is to the daily work of knitting ourselves back together after the fraying of consciousness during sleep. That reconsolidation of self - the daily sharpening of the mental pencil - took much longer than usual and I never quite felt complete. I began to think of caffeine as an essential ingredient for the construction of an ego.

Also unlike the edible grasses, the fat seeds of which we consume with virtually every meal, all we want from the tea and coffee plants are the molecules of caffeine and some characteristic flavors we extract from their leaves and seeds, respectively. So all we do with them is trivially lighten the weight of their vast biomass before simply dumping it all in landfills. Tons of these most valuable of all agricultural commodities are shipped from the tropics to the higher latitudes, there to be briefly soaked in hot water and then thoughtlessly discarded. Isn't there something ecologically absurd about moving all these leaves and seeds around the world merely to inflect water?

Cognitive psychologists sometimes talk in terms of two distinct types of consciousness: spotlight consciousness, which illuminates a single focal point of attention, making it very good for reasoning, and lantern consciousness, in which attention is less focused yet still illuminates a broader field of attention. Young children tend to exhibit lantern consciousness; so do many people on psychedelics. This more diffuse form of attention lends itself to mind wandering, free association, and the making of novel connections - all of which can nourish creativity. By comparison, caffeine's big contribution to human progress has been to intensify spotlight consciousness - the focused, linear, abstract and efficient cognitive processing more closely associated with mental work than with play. This, more than anything else, is what made caffeine the perfect drug not only for the age of reason and the Enlightenment, but for the rise of capitalism, too.

Many of the coffee plants grown in the New World today are descendants of that original plant smuggled out of Mocha in 1616, offspring of a theft nearly Promethean in its impact.

But the most important contribution that caffeine made to modern work - and, in turn, to the rise of capitalism, was to liberate us from the fixed rhythms of the sun, an astronomical timepiece that also sets the clocks of our bodies.

Looking at it that way, caffeine is a curse, addicting us to a regime that makes us more tractable and productive workers, speeding us up so that we may better keep pace with the manmade machinery of modern life.

In fact, one of the principal uses of sugar in Britain was as a sweetener of tea, and the custom drove a substantial increase in sugar consumption - which in turn drove an expansion of slavery to run the sugar plantations of the Caribbean. (An estimated 70% of the slave trade supported sugar production.) Coffee was even more directly implicated in the institution of slavery, especially in Brazil, where coffee growers imported large numbers of slaves from Africa to work on their plantations. How many tea and coffee drinkers in Europe had any idea that their sober and civilised habit rested on the back of such brutality?

"Don't take the names seriously," Trout told me, sending my mounting frustration. "The plants don't care what we call them."

The use of the term "Native American" became widespread during this period, throught to be more respectful than "Indian", a post-colonial term based on Columbus's epically faulty sense of direction. But "Native American" has its own origins problem, since the name "American" is also a European construct, and a ridiculous one at that - based on Amerigo Verpucci's bogus claim to have discovered the continent. Ralph Waldo Emerson called Vespucci a "thief" and a "pickle-dealer at Seville" who "managed in this lying world to supplant Columbus, and baptize half the earth with his dishonest name." According to the Census Bureau, in recent years more Indigenous respondents identify as "Indian" than "Native American." I use both terms here, but acknowledge that there is no satisfactory solution. (The Canadians have finessed this problems with the terms "First Nations" and "First Peoples").
