All the same, [care is] a tricky word. It’s a noun freighted with meaning and requiring qualification. It brings with it a hint of transaction, of an inequality, which is all the more uncomfortable if you’re caring for someone you love. By using it, however accurate it might be in terms of the day-to-day realities, there’s a risk that it redefines a partnership, a balanced give-and-take relationship, and turns it into an obligation: carer and patient, carer and client. One is active, the other passive, whereas every carer knows there’s nearly always some kind of reciprocity even in the darkest hours. You are still you, and they are still they.

Now, of course, I know that this sense of powerlessness, when watching someone you love struggle or suffer, is part and parcel of what it means to care.

My mother never used the word ‘carer’ about herself, even though she was always there at my father’s side when he needed her, believing that the word ‘wife’ contained multitudes.

It’s obvious, but it’s worth saying: if you have a positive image of what it means to be interdependent – not dependent, nor wholly independent, but rather part of a reciprocal and ever-changing relationship of shared experiences, common memories, affection – it can be less difficult when and if the time comes for you to step up. It is much easier, much more possible, to be an extra pair of hands if you have been shown from the cradle how to do it.

This paradox is at the heart of what it means to care – there are positives and negatives.

Each one of us who finds ourselves in this position will have different emotions, at different times, and depending on our personal circumstances, our feelings for the person for whom we are asked to care, their needs and long-term situation, our own sense of what we are capable of giving and what we might have to sacrifice.

It is about having a parallel life running alongside your own.

Too often, the system fails to care for those who are caring for others.

We should all be fighting for a higher standard of care for all of our older people, and those of any age who need additional support, so that dignity and choice are not simply a matter of postcode or family resources but rather built in to the heart of the system itself.
#ageing #older-adults #dignity

Key in the strategy for care (or, rather, the lack of it) is the absence of women legislators, politicians, CEOs, policy makers. Those who have never taken the primary caring role in any situation are, clearly, less likely to understand what it means to care, how one juggles work and emotional responsibility. They are less likely to understand how their very lack of compassion and practical experience makes them unfit to be dictating policy.

History matters, books matter. They entertain and illustrate and inform, they broaden our horizons. Novels, in particular, help us to process emotions and ideas, they enable us to stand in other people’s shoes and reflect our own lived experience back at us.

It is a great gift to have time to get to know your parents as people. As the selves they were before they were your mother and father.

It mattered, though. The aesthetics matter. Our NHS is amazing in the support and equipment it provides, but no one wants their house to look like a hospital ward. If possible, home needs to look like home.

I’d been raised to believe that it wasn’t a person’s age that made them a good companion but rather what they did, how they lived alongside others. Nine years old or ninety, it was a person’s character that mattered. Too often old age is presented as a problem to be solved, when it should be a cause for celebration that many women and men are living enjoyable, contented, valued and beloved lives well into their eighties and nineties. The language around ageing needs to change from negative to positive, from something seen as a regrettable challenge to a sign of success. Of course there are consequences of people living into their ninth, even their tenth or eleventh decade. First, the issue of quality of life. Improved life expectancy matters, yes, but so does living well and with dignity. Put simply, our bodies wear out with the passing of the years, regardless of whether or not we have some life-limiting or life-restraining illness.

On a day-to-day level, a change of both the language of ageing and attitudes expressed about it can make an immediate difference.

That this was normal. That this was just what it meant to be human. A wonderful, generous, compassionate human trying one’s best and occasionally falling short.

Several times in these past twelve years, I’ve remembered my naive younger self in that tomb in Egypt. And found comfort in how, despite the passing of time and the millennia of information, knowledge and progress, the ebbs and flows of human emotion remain the same down the centuries. The ancient Egyptians knew. And we know that those dark tipping hours in the middle of the night are the hardest. It’s then that self-pity and despair, doubts and regrets and anxiety creep in.

Sometimes, it’s just better to shut up. Not always put someone’s symptoms or their illness centre stage.

It was an unequal battle between his zest for life and a body that was failing.

For anyone of my parents’ generation, the war is always there in the background. It was the backdrop to their formative experiences as children or as teenagers; it shaped their emotions, their characters, their sense of safety and of self. As he talked, I marvelled at their resilience, that determination to get on with things and not make a fuss, their resolve to suffer ill health without complaint.

These challenges are complicated for the person for whom you are caring too. Most older people do not want, in Granny Rosie’s words, ‘to be a trouble’.

The list goes on. It’s easier said than done, I know, but it’s another reason why, even in those days where you want to do nothing but cry or shake your fists at the unfairness of it all, talking about caring in hopeful and positive terms matters.

To lose a parent is in the natural order of things. Children should outlive their parents. All the same, I’m not ready.

"I expect to pass through this world but once; any good thing therefore that I can do, or any kindness that I can show to any fellow human being, let me do it now; let me not defer or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again."

The clouds lift and you forget to be sad. Then you remember, and feel guilty. Holding on to the pain of their loss is a way of holding on to them.

No one knows what really goes on inside another marriage or relationship, even when you live at the closest quarters. There’s no doubt that there were frustrations and impatience, days of despair and irritation, moments when it all seemed too much or too unfair, that powerlessness again. There were disappointments, and sadnesses, and things that didn’t work out. Days of love and days of pity for the way of things. Children tend to romanticise their parents, perhaps. But, all the same, I can’t shake the haunting melody of Jacques Brel’s ‘La Chanson des Vieux Amants’ – ‘The Old Lovers’ – from my head, as he swears to his beloved how, from first light to the close of day, he will always love her.

The importance of older people having company of their own age, even if they have little else in common, is often underestimated. But we all understand what a relief it can be to have someone who simply knows and remembers the world that you once knew. Someone who has a similar frame of reference.

Left to my own devices, I’d survive on Marmite toast and baked potatoes. The occasional grape. There are other things I’d rather be doing.

From evenings spent in a special restaurant to the daily sandwich bought to punctuate the working day, from biscuits in the staffroom to cake in the office on someone’s birthday, we communicate with one another through the providing and sharing of food.

So my advice is that while it’s still possible to help someone to tick things off on their bucket list late into their lives, then do it if you can. It’s important that healthy older people are supported and not made to feel that they’re no longer allowed to aim for things or dream or have new experiences.

This adjustment from fiction to non-fiction happened slowly, unobserved. Unremarked. Finding my hands going to the ‘wrong’ shelves in a bookshop: Ann Patchett reflecting on her marriage and Atul Gawande’s Being Mortal. I wasn’t seeking guidance – at least, not consciously – but Gawande’s book was a catalyst to thought, to contemplation, to analysing why the world we are living in fails to deliver dignity, power, choice and humanity to so many at the end of their lives.

At A&E, the doctors and nurses are wonderful. Efficient, compassionate, wanting to know who my mother is as a person. My sisters arrive. An Iranian doctor on secondment talks about Ma being ‘rich in years’ and I am grateful to her for that kindness. [...] I will never stop being grateful that the hospital supported us too and did everything to treat Ma like an individual, with a long life behind her, not just another admission on a winter’s afternoon close to Christmas.

Grief is both universal and utterly particular.

There is something about being an orphan, the sudden severing from your childhood. There is no longer anyone who can fill in the blanks of memories and stories, the person who provided the framework of all the days of your lived life.

Coping with, and preparing for, grief is a key part of being a carer of an older person.

We often mistake a rigid timetable for efficiency.

We fail to conceal the idea that we think our time might be, somehow, more important than the cadence of hospital procedures, than the saving of a life, than the caring for someone critically or terminally ill. Beneath this impatience, perhaps, is a deeper fear that we are diminished by being patient. We feel invisible as the person we are. Just another number in the anonymous line.
