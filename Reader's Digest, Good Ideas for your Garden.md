One of the joys of gardening is that there is always more to learn. It is rare to find a gardener who is not entranced by fresh ideas. They are not easy to come by and, indeed, are more often found by chance - seen from a car or train window, for example - than by diligent research.

Part of gardening's enduring fascination, even for those who have made it their lifetime hobby, is the fact that it operates on so many different levels. There is the great joy to be gained from creating a pleasing display through an appropriate choice of plants, a display to satisfy the ears, eyes and nose. But on another level altogether there is the attraction of a garden which engages the intelligence with humour and surprise.

Potagers look somewhat flat unless you include plants that provide vertical points of interest.

As a single tall feature in a small potager, make an arbour at the centre where two paths cross.

Globe artichokes can do the same job for a single season. These imposing grey-green plants are like giant thistles with huge slower heads to pick at bud stage for a table delicacy.

Resolve what it is that you want from your garden tomorrow, next year and five years on.

The growing garden represents a complex process of development. As it matures, so your needs, and even your tastes, may alter. Your garden requires well-thought-out management and some general principles or rules for its development to make it work.

One of the hardest tasks for any gardener is to pause from cultivating plants long enough to take stock of the land they grow on. Even with a new garden the temptation is to buy plants immediately and set them out. But a garden is about more than growing a collection of plants. The longer you take to weigh up what the site has to offer and what plants will establish themselves best, the more harmonious the result is, and ultimately the more satisfying.

Wherever you live, the soil has had a long and complicated history, and so has the Earth's structure beneath it. What has been left over time is a remarkable diversity of ages and types of rock.
