It is the nature of the world that all things seek a rhythm, ad in that rhythm a sort of peace? Certainly it has always seemed so to me. All events, no matter how earth-shaking or bizarre, are diluted within moments of their occurrence by the continuance of the necessary routines of day-to-day living. Men walking a battlefield to search for wounded among the dead will stop to cough, to blow their noses, still lift their eyes to watch a V of geese in flight. I have seen farmers continue their ploughing and planting, heedless of armies crashing but a few miles away.

"Ruthlessness creates its own rules. So my mother taught me. Behave as if oyu cannot be touched and no one will dare to touch you." Regal
