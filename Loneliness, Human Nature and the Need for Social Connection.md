Transient loneliness is so common, in fact, that we simply accept it as a part of life. Humans are, after all, inherently social beings. When people are asked what pleasures contribute the most to happiness, the overwhelming majority rate love, intimacy, and social affiliation above wealth or fame, even above physical health. Given the importance of social conenction to our species, then, it is all the more torubling that, at any given time, roughly twenty percent of individuals - that would be sixty million people in the US alone - feel sufficiently isolated for it to be a major source of unhappiness in their lives.

Keep in mind, however, that we can all slip in and out of loneliness. Feeling lonely at any particular moment simply means that you are human. [...] Loneliness becomes an isue of serious concern only when it settles in long enough to create a persistent, self-reinforcing loop of negative thoughts, sensations, and behaviors.

Physical pain protects the individual from physical dangers. Social pain, also known as loneliness, evolved for a similar reason: because it protected the individual from the danger of remaining isolated.
#evolution 

In English, we have a word for pain and a word for thirst, but no single, specific terms that mean the opposite. We merely reference the absence of these aversive conditions, which makes sense, because their absence is considered part of the normal state.
#semantics 

Bringing together researchers from so many diverse fields has enabled us to look closely at each piece of the puzzle, but also to step back and consider the big picture in an integrated way.

For as long as our species has left traces, the evidence suggests that the most emotionally evocative experiences in life have been weddings, births, and deaths - events associated with the beginnings and endings of social bonds. These bonds are the centripetal force that holds life together.
#social-networks 

It should not be surprising, then, that the sensory experience of social connection, deeply woven into who we are, helps regulate our physiological and emotional equilibrium. The social environment affects the neural and hormonal signals that govern our behavior, and our behavior, in turn, creates changes in the social environment that affect our neural and hormonal processes.

In humans, loneliness itself has been shown to predict the progression of Alzheimer's disease. And one of our recent studies suggests that loneliness actually has the power to alter DNA transcription in the cells of your immune system. In these and myriad other ways, feelings of social connection, as well as feelings of disconnection, have an enormous influence on our bodies as well as our behaviors. We all decline physically sooner or later, but loneliness can increase the angle of the downward slope.

There are extremes within any population, but on average, at least among young adults, those who feel lonely actually spend no more time alone that do those who feel more connected. They are no more or less physically attractive,, and they do not differ, on average, from the non-lonely in terms of height, weight, age, education, or intelligence. Most important, when we look at the broad continuum (rather than just the extremes) of people who feel lonely, we find that they have the capacity to be just as socially adept as anyone else. Feeling lonely does not mean that we have deficient social skills. Problems arise when feeling lonely makes us less likely to employ the skills we have. 
#data 


The secret to gaining access to social connection and social contentment is being less distracted by one's own psychological business - especially the distortions based on feelings of threat.

The famed evolutionary biologist Edward O. Wilson describes the genes as providing a "leash" on our behavior, but a leash that is highly elastic. Our genetic inheritance imposes certain constraints, but it also allows considerable wiggle room.
#evolution 

The psychologist Donald Hebb has compared the query "Which contributes more to personality, nature or nurture?" to the question of which contributes more to the area of a rectangle, the length or the width. The answer is not either/or, but neither is it a both/and. It is not simply genes added to the environment, but genes interacting with the environment that typically determines the expression of most basic aspects of personality.

Reading and interpreting social cues is for any of us, at any time, a demanding and cognitively complex activity, which is why our minds embrace any shortcut that simplifies the job. We typically start by forming expectations emotionally, then use our reasoning powers to confirm what our emotions have led us to expect.

Living in groups placed a premium on having the ability to recognize the mental states of others - a capacity called "theory of mind." But once again, theory of mind if a form of social cognition, an ability that becomes readily distorted through the experience of loneliness.
#cognition 

Being able to self-regulate our emotions and our behaviors is a large part of what makes us human. The extent to which we rely on executive control to be an effective member of human society intensifies the tragedy when stroke, infection, or injury impairs the brain systems responsible for that control.

However wealthy and technologically adept our societies have become, beneath the surface we are the same vulnerable creatures who huddled together against the terrors of thunderstorms sixty thousand years ago.

The driving force of our advance as a species has not been our tendency to be brutally self-interested, but our ability to be socially cooperative.

In his book Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966), the evolutionary biologist George Williams summed up the idea with a direct contradiction of Hobbe's notion of early human existence as a constant state of battle: "Simply stated, an individual who maximizes his friendships and minimizes his antagonisms will have an evolutionary advantage, and selection should favor those characters that promote the optimization of personal relationships." And what we know from studies of the few pre-industrial, pre-agricultural social groups left on the planet supports this observation. 

Social insects coregulate by way of chemical communication; humans, having far greater behavioral latitude, rely heavily on culture, but the fact that humans can teach and learn about nongenetic (cultural) information about how to behave does not mean they have left body chemistry behind.

The genes provide the chemical carrots and sticks that guide behavior, but they depend on the sensory systems to actually interact with the environment.

The tandem of inheritance and individuality is why each of us experiences loneliness in a way that is unique, idiosyncratic, and grounded in the particulars of our life history and our own immediate situation. At the same time, however, loneliness also subsumes structural elements that are universal. Lying somewhere between the individual and the universal, there is also a role for distinctive cultural influences. 
#culture 

You can have all the "right" friends in terms of social prestige, in-group cachet, or business connections, or a spouse who is rich, brilliant, and fabulous looking, but if there is no deep, emotional resonance - specifically for you - then none of these relationships with satisfy the hunger for connection or ease the pain of feeling isolated.

Social environment definitely matters. It affects behavior by shaping norms, enforcing patterns of social control, providing or not providing opportunities to engage in particular behaviors, and either producing or reducing stress.

Our bodies still respond physiologically to the chronic, low-grade stressors of modern life as if we were still fighting tooth and claw, and with no regard for conserving resources for the golf or tennis we hope to play when we're seventy or the nice long walks we want to take when we're eighty. Such an extreme response substantially exceeds the metabolic requirements of dealing with the stressors we're up against. All the same, every jolt into an unnecessarily high gear requires a compensatory down-shift, and all of these changes, up and down, year after year (the allostatic load), add up, exacting a high price for what amounts to very little benefit.

Our studies of older adults yielded similar findings, and longitudinal analyses confirmed that it was loneliness specifically that was associated with changes in daytime fatigue. Even though the lonely got the same quantity of sleep as the nonlonely, their quality of sleep was greatly diminished.

Henry Melville: "We cannot live only for ourselves. A thousand fibers connect us with our fellow men; and along these fibers, as sympathetic threads, our actions run as causes, and they come back to us as effects." #cause-and-effect #community #consequences 

This is sometimes described as "mind over matter", sometimes dismissed as "it's all in your head." But in fact mind is matter, and there are very few mental activities in which interaction with the body is limited to the cranial area. #cartesian-duality 

Some individuals are, as a rule, simply less positive and cheerful than others, a genetic bias that appears to be related to which side of the individual's brain is generally more active. Negative emotions such as fear and disgust activate the right prefrontal regions more than tha left. Stimuli that evoke positive emotions acticate the left prefrontal regions more than the right. Individuals with greater baseline activation on the right side are more likely to be withdrawn, or to display greater negative affect as their everyday, run-of-the-mill emotional state. Children who display social competence show greater left frontal activation.

The social and the physiological cannot be separated any more than we can separate the length from the width of a rectangle.

The Germans have a word for closely attuned perception of another's emotional state. They call it Einfühlung, meaning "feeling into". 
#culture #linguistics 

According to the taxonomy popularized by Antonion Damasio, an emotion is a physical sensation. A "feeling" is an awareness of having an emotion. "Consciousness" is our awareness of the "self" having that feeling.

What this brief tour of neuroanatomy shows us is the degree to which the brain's resources are allocated to two of the things that matter most for human survival: emotional recognition, and other human beings.

Big brains don't rest on their laurels - they keep investing new things and creating new situations that demand even bigger brains.

Another study showed that when it comes to problem solving within a marriage, remaining cheerful and pleasant in outlook - even when that cheerfulness is combined with less than perfect communication skills - was far more predictive of keeping your partner happy than was being a grump who somehow manages to do or say exactly the right thing.

Social neuroscience shows us not only that there is no magical boundary between mind and body, but that the boundaries between ourselves and others are not nearly as fixed as we once imagined. #boundaries #self-and-other #cartesian-duality 

Part of the process of maturing into adulthood is gaining control over our unbridled emotions and impulses.

The great neurologist John Hughlings Jackson was the first to recognize that during maturation, individual deployment follows the same general pattern of layered upgrades, rather than downloads and overwrites, that unfolded over the course of the brain's evolution. This means that as we mature, rather than dispensing with our more infantile and animalistic impulses, we merely bring more sophisticated forms of processing online, which give us the ability to inhibit - sometimes with considerable effort - those lower-level responses. #software #evolution #growth 

Human beings are inherently meaning-making creatures, and the lonely are hardly unique in interpreting social cues through a highly subjective lens. The human brain must take disparate, atomistic snips of sensory input and weave them all into a "theory of the case", an interpretation of time and space, cause and effect, that allows us to survive today, plan for tomorrow, and make sense of the past. #meaningfulness 

Hope entails irrationality. Positive illusions about one's spouse contribute to longer and happier marriages. #hope
