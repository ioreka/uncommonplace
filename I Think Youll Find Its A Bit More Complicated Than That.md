Criticism and close examination of evidence is actively welcomed - it is the absolute core of the process - because ideas only exist to be pulled apart, and this is how we spiral in on the truth.

Here's no surprise: beliefs which we imagine to be rational are bound up in all kinds of other stuff. Political stances, for example, correlate with various personality features. One major review in 2003 looked at thirty-eight different studies, and found that overall, political conservativism was associated with things like death anxiety, fear of threat and loss, intolerance of uncertainty, a lack of openness to experience, and a need for order, structure and closure.

The scale of the academic universe is dizzying, after all. Our most recent estimate is that there are over 24,000 academic journals in existence, 1.3 million academic papers published every year, and over 50 million papers have been published since scholarship began.

We are living in an age of information, and vast tracts of data are being generated around the world, on every continent. A £200 laptop will let you run statistical analyses. The most interesting questions aren't around individual nuggets of data, but rather how we can corral it to create an information architecture which serves up the whole picture.

Much like Bruce Forsyth, the Royal Society has a catchphrase: *Nullius in verba*, of "On the word of nobody".

Open data - people posting their data freely for all to re-analyse - is the big hip new zeitgeist, and a vitally important new idea. But I was surprised to find that the thing I've advocated for wasn't enough: open data is sometimes no use, unless we also have open methods.
