Some labradors have a mutated gene, which sheds some light on their tendency to seem constantly hungry. The gene concerned, known as POMC, regulates how the brain recognises hunger and, in particular, the feeling of being full after a meal.

There is a phenomenon known as one-shot learning, which is fairly self-explanatory. The textbook example of one-shot learning is a toddler putting their hand into a fire. They only do it once and learn quickly and permanently not to do it again. The obvious downside to one-shot learning is that the level of stimulus required to create quick learning is extreme, usually involving a high degree of pain or fear. It's also, by its very nature, purely negative. There's no place in modern dog training for it, but I mention it purely to illustrate that if we're learning without pain or fear, it follows that we'll have to repeat things a lot.

Many of us are fascinated by psychology, both dog and human, but all too often it's couches in technical jargon which can make it seem impenetrable. If you're anything like me, you really don't need impenetrable: you need simple, practical and effective rules to follow.

It's surprising what you pick up when you listen with your eyes.

Little humans learn very quickly. A 2017 report published in _Applied Psycholinguistics_ journal found that one-year-old children recognise around 50 words; three-year-olds, typically 1,000 words, and by the age of five, children can recognise at least 10,000 words. 
The average American native speaker of English, it turns out, has a vocabulary of 42,000 words by the time they are 20. This rises to 48,000 by the age of 60. That's around 50 times more words than the smartest dog ever tested.

The big surprise was that dogs do something which had previously only been seen in humans and other primates - they scan the left side of a person's face as they see it, first and foremost (ie the person's right side). It's a neat trick, called left gaze bias, which saves time in not processing data because faces are, to a large extent, symmetrical. More significantly, perhaps, when humans scan the left side of someone's face, the information is processed in the right hemisphere of our brains, where facial and emotional recognition takes place. The inference is that dogs may be instinctively using left gaze bias to understand our facial expressions both quickly and accurately. Clever dogs.

Dogs struggle to connect consequences - good or bad - with anything that happens after the event, even by a few seconds, let alone minutes. In order for a dog to understand, the response has to happen while the behaviour is ongoing, or, at the very least, immediately afterwards. The term for this phenomenon is _temporal contiguity_. In other words, together in time.

People hang onto emotions longer than dogs hang onto delivery people. That isn't to say dogs don't have remember things. On the contrary, they have great memories. The problem is, we can't use language to explain what they did wrong.

Social media acts in the same way. It works on a variable-reward schedule and the reward it offers is perhaps the most intoxicating to humans: approval.

Alice was autistic, which may or may not be significant. I've found that many autistic people seem to really 'get' animals.
