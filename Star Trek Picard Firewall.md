It had intimidated Seven when she first encountered it, but in time she saw the truth that was hidden in the pantomime of violence. No one was in the most pit to hurt people. They were all hungry for contact, for connection, for a sense of belonging to something greater. And the moshers protected each other in ways that others outside the pit couldn't usually see. If someone fell, the other moshers pulled them back up. Couples or groups often laid claim to spaces by clutching one another and spinning around. The pit wasn't competitive. It wasn't territorial. It was communal. It looked like chaos and danger to the uninitiated, but to those inside it was safety in numbers, a huge embrace of like-minded souls.

"Societies depend on the good faith of those who govern them more than folks realize. People count on shame to keep bad actors in line. But when someone utterly shameless comes along and just runs roughshod over the law? No one knows what to do." Harper
