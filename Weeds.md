Weeds are nature's first responders, healing the wounds that man inflicts upon the earth.

Does being native matter? Our perceptions are very much a question of time: many of our most-loved wildflowers such as field poppies and cornflowers are technically just as non-native as Japanese knotweed, yet because they've been here for many hundreds of years we've grown to appreciate and even love them.

While we carefully cultivate agapanthus in Britain, it's considered a weed in parts of Australia (it's not native there either). There really is no such thing as a definitive weed. Weeds are much more a perception than a definition.

Weeds are at work everywhere. An unsprayed lawn, full of clover, dandelions and yarrow, will survive downpours better than a pure grass one because  its more diverse root structure improves drainage. It also feeds itself (clover makes its own fertiliser by "fixing" nitrogen from the air) and will stay greener for longer in drought conditions.

Eden Phillpots: "The universe is full of magical things, patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper."

Another way of looking at it is to admit that nature is never still, yet in Britain our definition of nativeness freezes our flora into a snapshot of what it was many thousands of years ago, not allowing for the fact that species' natural ranges change over time. What's more, climate change is making our definition of "native" less relevant by the day.

Sycamores support a greater mass of insects than oaks (although not as many different species).

Daisies are members of the plant family _Asteraceae_ - which is a huge plant family with more than 32,000 species, including garden flowers like sunflowers and echinaceas, along with lots of weeds such as dandelions, thistles and ragwort.

In fact, according to one study, marsh thistle (_Cirsium palustre_) is one of our top five best floral resources for pollinators measured in kilos of nectar per unit area per year; along with heather and white clover, it provides 50% of the national nectar provision.

Thistles aren't much of a problem in traditional hay meadows, but they are in the intensively grazed systems that became much more common in the post-war era. More than 97% of our hay meadows are gone, as is so much of our wildlife. As we are realising today, at our cost, it's generally much better to work with nature, rather than against it. These "weeds" are there for a reason, and they always have something to tell us. Thistles are nature's way of breaking up compacted soil, and ensuring that even overgrazed pastures provide some nectar for pollinating insects.

Theirs was a very different world to ours. During their heyday in the late Devonian and Carboniferous periods (around 380-300 million years ago), horsetail species that are now extinct grew to 20m high and formed huge primeval forests inhabited by amazing creatures such as dragonflies with wingspans nearly 1m across. If you've ever picked up a lump of coal, you've touched the forest remains of these forests - a vivid demonstration that coal really is the definitive fossil fuel!

Boldly coloured and reflective, buttercup petals have been shown to have mirror-like qualities, reflecting ultraviolet light to attract pollinating insects. Imagine that: those shining stars are a carpet of bee beacons, glowing in colours invisible to human eyes.

The buttercup petal arrangement also acts as a parabolic mirror, reflecting infrared light to the centre of the flower, gently heating it to attract insects and increase the chance of fertilisation.

Similarly, reflective petals are found in celandines, which are members of the same family, _Ranunculaceae_, along with hellebores and clematis. _Ranunculus_ comes from the Latin for "little frog", and like frogs, buttercups enjoy life in damp places.

When you look at what ivy is, what it can do and how much life it supports, calling it a weed seems hugely ungrateful. Aside from its amazing wildlife credentials, it's one of our most useful and versatile plants - is there another species capable of being grown as a groundcover plant, a shrub, a bedding plant, and houseplant _and_ a climber?

The only evergreen climber nature to Britain, ivy is a woody vine that can grow up to 30m tall. 
Ivy transforms bare tree trunks into tower blocks for wildlife. 
More than 100 species of insects and 17 species of birds feed on ivy in the UK. There's even a special ivy bee, which looks like a fluffy ginger honeybee.
A NASA study showed that ivy has impressive abilities to remove harmful chemicals from the air on board its spacecraft.
It's an effective insulator - if you grow it on the outside walls of your house, it will keep you warmer in winter and cooler in summer.
However, not all Ivy climbs. Once the plant has established itself on a wall or tree it suddenly changes its habit. The plant switches from a juvenile (climbing) phase to an adult, shrubby (arborescent) one. Even the leaf shape changes, from five pointed to oval.
Only once it becomes arborescent will it begin to product those wildlife-tastic flowers.
Many people think that ivy is a parasite on trees, but this isn't true. It doesn't penetrate the bark, and has a very clever method of attachment.  

As author and broadcaster Richard Mabey points out, bluebells perfectly demonstrate the "weed is a plant in the wrong place" principle.

Himalayan balsam is our tallest wild annual plant. A true vegetable vagabond, Himalayan balsam is a bold and beautiful plant that turns some of our most polluted industrial backwaters into a sea of flowers. Adored by bees yet outlawed by humans, this plant shows the fascinating interplay between botany and humanity. Its story is still unfolding.

Duckweed might seem familiar, but look closely: every single thing about it is strange and incredible. One of the world's smallest flowering plants, it can make water look like land, and it's even edible.

Weirdly, duckweed shares a habit with drought-loving cacti in that it doesn't differentiate between stems and leaves. It just is.
This vigorous growth helps to clean the water below, and can be used in a process called "phytoremediation" to remove industrial pollution and excess nutrients from farm runoff.
Duckweed is an important part of the aquatic food chain too. It shelters a lot of aquatic life. It can even cut down algae and mosquito problems.

Being not only edible but medicinal and ornamental too, mallow is one of the friendliest wild plants. If it were hard to grow, we'd all be buying it. But because it has the temerity to grow so freely, uninvited, in such undignified spots as pavement cracks, it is tarred forever with the label "weed".

One of the skills that really good gardeners have is to be able to recognise all manner of seedlings, and evaluate them for what they can offer before deciding to weed them out. Learning to spot potentially useful volunteers (aka "weeds") can make your garden more beautiful and much less work.

Compaction does terrible things to soil, literally squeezing the air and life out of it - plantain is nature's rescue remedy, as its tough fibrous roots simultaneously break up compressed layers while protecting soil from future erosion. These strong roots also help the plant accumulate useful quantities of minerals such as calcium and sulphur, adding to its health-giving qualities (it is useful in pasture too for grazing animals).

One of the nine sacred herbs of the Saxons (alongside mugwort), broadleaf plantain has medicinal qualities that are still used today. The leaves have antibacterial properties and make a useful first aid remedy for minor cuts and scrapes.

Japanese knotweed: You could view it as nature's most strident first responder to the wounds left on earth's surface by us. The plant's strongholds are mostly in urban areas, particularly along railway lines and where buildings have been demolished. In its natural habitat in Japan it's one of the first colonizers of fresh lava flows - kickstarting the long, slow process of turning barren black rock into fertile soil. 

From destroying patios to contributing to the fight against cancer and helping our beleaguered bees, Japanese knotweed is a complex, resilient, slightly terrifying plant, and one that deserves our respect if nothing else.

A single _Rhododendron ponticum_ plant can, by rooting where its branches touch the soil, cover more than 100 square metres. Plus it engages in chemical warfare (allelopathy) to subdue other plants nearby.

Learning to use weeds as a tool to direct your gardening is a valuable skill. Creeping buttercup in your lawn is generally a sign that it's too wet for short grass to thrive. This presents you with a choice: spray and drain it in pursuit of the perfect bowling green lawn, killing the wildlife and making a lot of work for yourself in the process. Or, listen to what nature is telling you. leave the mower in the shed and watch the lawn become a wildflower meadow studded with beautiful flowers and humming with life. Sometimes the most rewarding way of gardening if to let nature do it for you.

Brambles are perplexing plants. On the one hand, they're generous providers of tasty fruit with many health-giving properties - and on the other they're fearsomely armed vegetable warriors, ready to scratch you to pieces and take over your garden. If you take a step back, however, and look at the bigger picture, those thorns have an important ecological role to play. 

Sometimes known as nature's barbed wire, brambles are impressively armoured. Even the backs of the leaves have thorns. This prickliness serves an important purpose: thorny bramble thickets are a haven for the small and the young things of this world. Small birds, mammals, and even sapling trees find refuge in the bramble patch, safe from predators and browsing animals. Hence the old saying, "thorn is the mother of the oak" - brambles are a key part of the natural regeneration of forests.

Brambles are one of the reasons no one can quite put a figure on how many native plants there are in Britain and other temperate parts of Eurasia. Botanically speaking, there're as tangled as a bramble patch. Taxonomists struggle to agree exactly what's what, so _Rubus fruticosus_ is classed as an "aggregate" species, being made up of more than 300 microspecies. You'll see this if oyu go bramble picking - the size, shape and taste of the plants varies enormously.

When docks eventually die, the field is opened up to all sorts of plants that couldn't have grown there before. Dock seeds can remain viable for 60 years or more.

Both nightshades have interesting reproductive habits. Pollen is a precious resource: the plant requires a lot of energy to make it, so nightshades go to incredible lengths to ensure as little as possible is wasted. Having evolved in tandem with bees for thousands upon thousands of years, nightshades decided that instead of offering a banquet of pollen laid out like many other more wasteful plants, they would shed their pollen only through pores, only to be released by the buzz of bumblebees as they hang onto the flowers, contracting their flight muscles to reach just the right vibration. Once it hits the right note, a highly targeted explosion of pollen covers the lucky bee. Tomatoes share the same traits (compare their flowers and their close family links become obvious) which is by bumblebees are bred in their millions to pollinate commercial tomato crops.

Once you've eaten chickweed leaves, you'll think it's madness to weed the plant out, only to go and buy a bagged-up salad that's been driven hundreds of miles on a fume-belching lorry.

Nettles' use as fabric goes back to the Vikings and beyond, way before the introduction of cotton from the tropics. 

Nettles are a superb aphid and caterpillar plant. So what? Well, we're used to thinking of krill or plankton as being the basic of the ocean food chain, supporting everything from sardines to sperm whales. Aphids and caterpillars are the same on land. Bring them in and suddenly there's food for blue tits, ladybirds, and a host of other creatures. Nettles are also the larval food plant for peacock, red admiral and small tortoiseshell butterflies.

the name "dandelion" comes from the French _dent de lion_ (lion's tooth) although no one is quite sure why. In France it's generally called "pissenlit" which relates rather forthrightly to the old English name of pee-the-bed. Despite their less than appealing local moniker, dandelions are loved in France where they're grown as an edible crop.

Clovers are what's known as legumes, being in the _Leguminosae_ or pea family, and in common with the rest of their kin they have the ability to 'fix' nitrogen from the air. Nitrogen is an incredible important element for plants; it's what keeps them green and healthy. Humans discovered how to make artificial nitrogen 100 years ago and it's now one of the most environmentally damaging things we do. It causes about 1% of all human emissions of carbon dioxide, along with widespread water pollution caused by the run-off of excess fertiliser.
