"But it's worse'n that. The other side's got an energy that our side en't got. Comes from their certainty about being right. If you got that certainty, you'll be willing to do anything to bring about the end you want. It's the oldest human problem, Lyra, an' it's the difference between good and evil. Evil can be unscrupulous, and good can't. Evil has nothing to stop it doing what it wants, while good has one hand tied behind its back. To do the things it needs to do to win, it'd have to become evil to do them." Fader Coram

"Yes, the secret commonwealth... You don't hear much talk about that these days. When I was young there wasn't a single bush, not a single flower nor a stone, that didn't have its own proper spirit. You had to have a mind to your manners around them, to ask for pardon, or for permission, or give thanks... Just to acknowledge that they were there, them spirits, and they had their proper rights to recognition and courtesy."

The question was, she thought, was the universe alive or dead?

Some years before, in Oxford, she'd had an encounter with the daemon of a witch, in a little adventure that had culminated in her thinking that everything meant something, if only she could read it. The universe had seemed alive then. There were messages to be read everywhere you looked.

Spirit is what matter does.

She couldn't get any further at that point. The sky full of stars seemed dead and cold, everything in it the result of the mechanical, indifferent interactions of molecules and particles that would continue for the rest of time whether Lyra lived or died, whether human beings were conscious or unconscious: a vast silent empty indifference, all quite meaningless. 
Reason has brought her to this state. She had exalted reason over every other faculty. The result had been - was now - the deepest unhappiness she had ever felt.

Gradually as Lyra watched she found her mood lifting. She'd hardly been aware of feeling anxious, but that was because anxiety was everywhere, built into the very molecules of the world, or so it had seemed. But now it was disappearing, like heavy grey clouds thinning and dispersing and finding their great grey banks of vapour drifting into wisps that wafted away into invisibility, leaving the sky clear and open. She felt her whole self, including the absent Pan, becoming light and free.
