Sam said nothing. The look on Frodo’s face was enough for him; he knew that words of his were useless. And after all he never had any real hope in the affair from the beginning; but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed hope, as long as despair could be postponed.

"Maybe there is no right choice," said Gimli.

At first Merry and Pippin were struck chiefly by the variety that they saw: the many shapes, and colours, and differences in girth, and height, and length of leg and arm; and in the number of toes and fingers (anything from three to nine). A few seemed more of less related to Treebeard, and reminded them of beech-trees or oaks. But there were other kinds. Some recalled the chestnut: brown-skinned Ents with large splayfingered hands, and short thick legs. Some recalled the ash: tall straight grey Ents, with many-fingered hands and long legs; some the firt (the tallest Ents), and others the birch, the rowan, and the linden. But when all Ents gathered around Treebeard, bowing their heads slightly, murmuring in their slow musical voices, and looking long and intently at the strangers, then the hobbits saw that they were all of the same kindred, and all had the same eyes: not all so old or so deep as Treebeard's, but all with the same slow, steady, thoughtful expression, and the same green flicker.

"But I have an odd feeling about these Ents: somehow I don't think they are quite as safe and, well funny as they seem. They seem slow, queer, and patient, almost sad; and yet I believe they _could_ be roused. If that happened, I would rather not be on the other side." Merry

They walked along the rim of the great bowl at the feet of the evergreens - it was pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again, and not to be in a hurry - and then they climbed down to the gushing water. They drank a little, a clean, clod, sharp draught, and sat down on a mossy stone, watching the patches of sun on the grass and the shadows of the sailing clouds passing over the floor of the dingle.

All that day they walked about in the woods with him, singing, and laughing; for Quickbeam often laughed. He laughed if the sun came out from behind a cloud, he laughed if they came upon a stream or spring,: then he stooped and splashed his feet and head with water; he laughed sometimes at some sound or whisper in the trees. Whenever he saw a rowan tree he halted a while with his arms stretched out, and sang, and swayed as he sang.

"Of course, it is likely enough, my friends," he said slowly, "likely enough that we are going to _our_ doom: the last march of the Ents. But if we stayed home and did nothing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later. That thought has long been growing in our hearts; and that is why we are marching now."

Deserves death! I daressay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give that to them? Then be not too eager to deal out death in the name of justice, fearing for your own safety. Even the wise cannot see all ends.

This was an evil choice. Which way should he choose? And if both led to terror and death, what good lay in choice?

Ithilien, the garden of Gondor now desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness.

The burned hand teaches best. After that advice about fire goes straight to the heart.

It was Sam's first view of a battle of Men against Men, and he did not like it much. He was glad that he could not see the dead face. He wondered what the man's name was and where he had come from; and if he really was evil of heart, or what lies or threads had led him on the long march from his home; and if he would not really rather have stayed there in peace - all in a flash of thought which was quickly driven from his mind.

War must be, while we defend our lifes against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend: the city of the Men of Númenor; and I would have her loved for her memory, her ancientry, her beauty, and her present wisdom. Not feared, save as men may fear the dignity of a man, old and wise.

"Most gracious host," said Frodo, "it was said to me by Elrond Halfelven that I should find friendship upon the way, secret and unlooked for. Certainly I looked for no such friendship as you have shown. To have found it turns evil to great good."
