Because women have always gardened, but our stories have been buried with our work. We have ushered herbs from the ground and dried them for healing; we have braided seeds into our hair even when the future looks bloody and uncertain; we have silently made the world more beautiful, too often without acknowledgement.

I have always learned about plants through their stories: how they came here, what they represent, what silent powers they hold and who they mean something to.

I loved Matt, and I wanted to marry him, but I knew that binding my life to a man would come with a compromise he would not have to carry. A wedding is something that complicates and enchants. It changes the lives of the women who seek it, whatever the reason.

To share a home - a life - with someone is to compromise with them and to share yourself.

But here, breathed out through the steam of a mug, is something clear and glittering. It makes me realise that gardening is vital, something beating and alive, and more deeply resonant than mere hobby.

"I do think loneliness goes with being indoors a little bit," Mel says. "I don't think I've ever felt lonely outside as such. In the garden, there's always some noise, wherever you are. I think it would be hard to dwell on that feeling if you're outside, but very easy if you're inside."

"As someone who has decided not to have children, I think it's imperative to have a more expansive and inclusive view of how women bring value using our inherent human skills redirected to other places." Louise

Perseverance is crucial in tending to a garden but it is also overlooked. A lot of fuss is made about knowledge and technique - how and when to prune the roses, when to coddle and when to encourage resilience, Latin names - but the most beautiful gardens, I think, are the ones made with persistence and determination. It takes a lot of effort to turn a concrete yard into a sunflower patch, to persist in borrowing library books and coaxing growth from the stubborn earth without the reassurance that a grounding in botany can offer. Many of the women I spoke with had deployed this tenacity to the spaces they grew in, a refusal to let go or give up. It was rarely spoken about with pride, but rather just something that they did.

It feels sort of mad and opulent to just stand there, throwing these tiny things about, firm in the knowledge that many of them could get lost in the wind or the mouths of birds. Perhaps some, a fraction, will stick and germinate. I hope so, I so hope so.

But a garden doesn't have to contain herbs to be considered healing.

She didn't know how to garden, but, she explained, she was fearless: "I was like 'What am i fearful of?' Most people are fearful of death. What's the ultimate fear? Dying. Well, I've gone through that."

In recent years 'nature' more broadly has been positioned as a healer, but I think this oversimplifies a complex relationship and one more innately grounded in us than we understand. I did not need to 'recover' from the heartbreak that made me see plants differently [...] but still people would ask how gardening had 'healed' me. I didn't see it that way. Spending more time observing and engaging with how plants grew allowed me to see a world I'd previously been blind to, that of the natural biological rhythms of the year. When I started to live more closely to those cycles, to grow plants and witness the change in their lives, I was better able to understand that what happened in mine was part of something far greater.

But if we only expect nature, or our gardens, to heal us - to make us feel better, to provide a balm or solace fro our daily problems - how reciprocal can our relationship with the earth really be, and how thoroughly are we understanding the problems it is facing?

Maya has led me to a greater understanding of them; she has shown me the generosity of the earth, that growing is better when it is reciprocal.
#reciprocity 

So often we think of gardens as physical spaces. Spaces defined by hedges, by ownership, by meaning.
