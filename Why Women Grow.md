Because women have always gardened, but our stories have been buried with our work. We have ushered herbs from the ground and dried them for healing; we have braided seeds into our hair even when the future looks bloody and uncertain; we have silently made the world more beautiful, too often without acknowledgement.

I have always learned about plants through their stories: how they came here, what they represent, what silent powers they hold and who they mean something to.
#narrative #stories 

I loved Matt, and I wanted to marry him, but I knew that binding my life to a man would come with a compromise he would not have to carry. A wedding is something that complicates and enchants. It changes the lives of the women who seek it, whatever the reason.
#marriage 

To share a home - a life - with someone is to compromise with them and to share yourself.

But here, breathed out through the steam of a mug, is something clear and glittering. It makes me realise that gardening is vital, something beating and alive, and more deeply resonant than mere hobby.

"I do think loneliness goes with being indoors a little bit," Mel says. "I don't think I've ever felt lonely outside as such. In the garden, there's always some noise, wherever you are. I think it would be hard to dwell on that feeling if you're outside, but very easy if you're inside."

"As someone who has decided not to have children, I think it's imperative to have a more expansive and inclusive view of how women bring value using our inherent human skills redirected to other places." Louise

Perseverance is crucial in tending to a garden but it is also overlooked. A lot of fuss is made about knowledge and technique - how and when to prune the roses, when to coddle and when to encourage resilience, Latin names - but the most beautiful gardens, I think, are the ones made with persistence and determination. It takes a lot of effort to turn a concrete yard into a sunflower patch, to persist in borrowing library books and coaxing growth from the stubborn earth without the reassurance that a grounding in botany can offer. Many of the women I spoke with had deployed this tenacity to the spaces they grew in, a refusal to let go or give up. It was rarely spoken about with pride, but rather just something that they did.
#persistence #determination 

It feels sort of mad and opulent to just stand there, throwing these tiny things about, firm in the knowledge that many of them could get lost in the wind or the mouths of birds. Perhaps some, a fraction, will stick and germinate. I hope so, I so hope so.

But a garden doesn't have to contain herbs to be considered healing.

She didn't know how to garden, but, she explained, she was fearless: "I was like 'What am i fearful of?' Most people are fearful of death. What's the ultimate fear? Dying. Well, I've gone through that."
#life-and-death #fear 

In recent years 'nature' more broadly has been positioned as a healer, but I think this oversimplifies a complex relationship and one more innately grounded in us than we understand. I did not need to 'recover' from the heartbreak that made me see plants differently [...] but still people would ask how gardening had 'healed' me. I didn't see it that way. Spending more time observing and engaging with how plants grew allowed me to see a world I'd previously been blind to, that of the natural biological rhythms of the year. When I started to live more closely to those cycles, to grow plants and witness the change in their lives, I was better able to understand that what happened in mine was part of something far greater.
#systems-thinking 

But if we only expect nature, or our gardens, to heal us - to make us feel better, to provide a balm or solace fro our daily problems - how reciprocal can our relationship with the earth really be, and how thoroughly are we understanding the problems it is facing?
#climate-change

Maya has led me to a greater understanding of them; she has shown me the generosity of the earth, that growing is better when it is reciprocal.
#reciprocity 

So often we think of gardens as physical spaces. Spaces defined by hedges, by ownership, by meaning.

My time with Maya suggested that the relationship between healing and growing is an active thing, as thorny and beautiful as the May tree that first captured her attention in Scotland. It is more complicated than learning what plants can do for us; we have to offer some of ourselves to the land to reap the benefits.
#reciprocity #health 

Of course I don't _want_ to die, she adds, unprompted. I want to live forever. But there's a nice saying that gardeners can't die because they've got to see how the garden is coming on.
#death 

This retreat is so necessary in our gardens that I thought it must be necessary in our lives, too. Maya, like Schiller, had shown me that retreat - to the land and the big skies, to 'nature' beyond a city - was complex but nevertheless crucial. I wondered if, by learning to be dormant, we could live more vibrantly.

Such is the smallness of Martha's life here, and the contrast with the enormity of her surroundings, that she's found her thought process deepen. She tells me about how she used to think about plants and horticulture, and I recognise it completely: 'I used to have that urgency of "I must capture this thing and then put it in my brain so then if someone asks me about it, I can say "Yes" and give its Latin name"'. Now, she tells me, she's keen to seek out different connotations - ones beyond the mere collection of information, an accumulation of knowledge that may have to be deployed. 'I just like to go and experience them and then see how they change,' she says. 'I see it as a kind of, like a curiosity thing.'

For all the generosity of the soil - the fruit and flowers it throws up, the corms and tubers it can swallow - there is somehow always more room for human feelings.
#generosity 

Sometimes during the conversations I was having, the young woman I had been would come to mind. If you plant a bulb the wrong way round, the shoot will grow beside it to find the light. Pull a bare-root plant from the soil and you'll see small leaves ready to emerge. The mulch I top the containers with was once plants. Even in these changes states, everything has been the same matter at one time or another.
#transformation #lifecycle 

Hearing Louise talk about space made me re-evaluate those I had made and those we make as women in defiance of what is expected of us. Girls are raised with a keen and unavoidable understanding of beauty standards, but when women make gardens, we make spaces that we define as beautiful on our own terms. 
#beauty 

The fingerprints of abuse still lie on my body. Small and featherlight, banal and unique. A scar that left me marked and turned me from an innocent, of sorts, into a survivor. While I had no choice over their existence - they were imprinted upon me - I could choose what to do with them. Whether I would let them define me, whether I would keep them secret, at what point I would put them on show, if at all. I had existed for a good while without being aware of them: our brains are good at burying trauma; my mind was adept at denial and reconfigured the facts. But what I think those fingerprints did do was to galvanise me. The muscles beneath the skin they touched grew hard and sinewy. They became strong and fierce and resilient and encouraged my voice to follow suit. I stood louder and taller for women's rights, called out sexism and gave it more scrutiny. Where once my experiences - that victimhood - made me lonely, I learned to recognise them as a ticket to a sisterhood. That I was one of the millions of women who knew what it was to have their choice taken away, that I could recognise their pain and turn it into power.
#trauma 

I'd held onto the notion of breaking ground since the beginning of all this, of gardening as rebellion and of making change. Ground can be broken from above, with the blunt edge of a spade or the swinging thud of a mattock, but I tended to picture it from below: the gentle, determined force that pushed the curved neck of a seedling stem through the soil above. It was a power that always impressed and surprised me, that emergence of life and potential from the earth.
#potential #lifecycle 

But as the months shifted, and the garden grew, I realised that being a good custodian of the earth was often more in what we didn't do - what we left alone to flourish and take up space - than in how we intervened.

Nothing comes out of the earth without having been placed there first. Matter rots down into nutrients, seeds are scattered, rain falls. The power in a handful of soil is hidden and dormant until the right conditions - the pressures and alchemy - are right for growth and change to emerge.
#patience 

Whim and curiosity are what have taken me across the country, to other women's homes, to their retreats and their favourite park benches. I'm beginning to see why, I'm beginning to see what I'm learning: that to be a woman is complex and powerful, something that is learned in the doing, and that our stories need to be louder.

To have a garden is one privilege, to have the time, means and confidence to tend to it is another, and to ignore the political structures that have enabled both is a third.
#privilege 

It's been years, and I still find the term 'gardening' an ineffective word for what I do outside - sinking my hands in the earth, watching root and stem curl from cracked seed casings, finding something new has blossomed in the early hours of a summer morning. It has so many twee associations, of neatness and nicety; a prissiness that feels deeply removed from the thudding compulsion that draws me outside.
#naming 

When we garden, we change a small part of how the world works. The decisions we make - whether to spray our lawns or not whether we garden for the environment, or not - have impact. Of course our gardens are political spaces.

I am still learning the politics of gardening, just as I am still learning about its plants and science and seasons. One of the reasons why many of us grow, I think, is because it is a constant education.
#pursuit-of-knowledge #education #growth-mindset 

The more I learn about what it deeply means to garden, the more I appreciate its beauty: not just in the aesthetics of what appears from the ground, in the colours and shapes, but in the act itself. How brave and how brilliant to make a change in the world around you by making a choice in the ground around you. How potent to know that in the physical acts of gardening - of moving your body, smothering mulch, scattering seeds - you are contributing to something bigger than your back garden. How much more it all means with this knowledge than without.
#meaningfulness 

These are the kinds of gardens I fell for years ago, the gardens that presented themselves as a language I wanted to learn.

She stops for a minute, and her round cheeks rise: 'Finding newts in the compost and having to rehome them. Cutting the lavender. I can just take a minute, whilst I'm cutting and just breathe, feel the sun on my face. Can't do that if I'm sitting on a checkout, or if I was in an office.'

I believed that was the impetus: that going to ground enabled grassroots change. What I found instead was a compulsion. One to do better, to make better, to put back in the earth matter that humans have eroded away, to create safe spaces to incite change in a world that incites so much rage and violence.

Jamaica Kincaid - The Garden I Have In Mind: "Memory is a gardener's real palette; memory as it summons up the past, memory as it shapes the present, memory as it dictates the future."
#memory 

Our memories do inform our gardens; we grow plants to remember people by, to mark particular moments in our life.

One tiny revelation that felt like it changed everything. How swift I was, how unchallenged I was, in believing the men in my life were responsible for these things. How easily a woman's work - and with it, her wisdom, her fascination, her studies - is diminished.
#gender 

"There are a lot of things in life where you might feel a bit intimidated," she explains. "You'll see what someone else has done, or made, and covet it. But I never get that with gardening. Never, ever get that with gardening. I don't care if my garden isn't someone else's aesthetic, it makes me happy and I get what I need from it. I don't feel that it needs to be perfect. I don't feel it has to be necessarily full of flowers. People seem to not like green so much but I love green. They don't think that's exciting enough. But to me it is."

So often green is a background colour in a garden, relegated to lawn and anonymous shrubs. It can be easy to overlook, this building block of the things we grow, the stuff of cells and chemistry.

When we lose someone, we turn to the earth. we bury our dead, we scatter their ashes in their favourite places. We plants trees to welcome babies and we plant trees to mark our grief, too. But we also go to ground to connect with pasts we can't unravel, to find parts of our heritage that don't exist on paper or in others' bodies, to make sense of who we are.

"What I love about gardening is failure is almost never made total." Fernanda points to a rather sad straggle in a pot. "This is failing. But I have some bok choi over there that's full size."
#failure 

It wasn't so much that the plants had rooted Fernanda but that in growing them she created a space of her own - of experimentation, of food, of beauty, of delight - in new surroundings. I found so much courage in that: to invest in pots of soil no matter what the future might be.

Tend to a garden - create it from the ground up, inherit another's plot, sit back and return it to the wild - and it becomes a space to enact and to mirror the matter of life.

After sorting the house, Caroline explains, with mirth, 'you start for the rest of your life on the garden, which just carries on and on, and then ends up taking up the rest of your time endlessly.'

"You can't stand alongside a tree and ever think that your worries matter, because that tree has been here for hundreds of years and seen much more things under its boughs than you've ever seen. it just gently reminds you that there's a bigger order, and on it goes, really"
#perspective 

Looking and tending to plants made sense - more than drinking, more than parting - because when I did I could see something bigger. I had little control over where I would live or what the shape of my life would be, but I could understand how the seasons worked, I could find meaning in the rise of a green shoot from the earth.

We have been taught that to lose control is to lose. So when we choose to let go in the garden - to let the weeds flower, the grass grow long, the pests multiply - it is a far bolder choice than it may seem. We are showing that we are doing as we please, that we are ushering in the wild and seeing what happens. We are reclaiming beauty as something tumbling and unexpected, rather than the tight, shining standards we have been raised with.

"I associate the brevity of our lives and the determination to last beyond the gravity of our lives, one way or another, with roses," she says. They are a plant, she explains, that exist long beyond their brief flourish. "Whenever I think about roses, I have it in my head that there are next year's roses, and the year after that. Roses always reach ahead."

I think about what we leave behind in a space. This was a garden created by another woman, and held close. When we make space, we do so knowing we will inevitably leave it.

Women grow because the earth can swallow feelings that the air can't.
