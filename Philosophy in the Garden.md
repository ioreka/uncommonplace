Gardens are a bulwark against distraction. Philosophy is a gregarious pursuit, which thrives on social ferment. But too much stimulation leads to madness, not meditation.

The garden is not simply a retreat or source of physical exercise. It is intellectually stimulating in its own right, because it is a fusion of two fundamental philosophical principles: humanity and nature. This is suggested by the word itself, and its cognates in German and the Romance languages: _Garten, jardin, giardino_. Like the English "yard", they refer to enclosure, which requires two things: _something_ cordoned off (nature), and _someone_ doing the cordoning (humanity). Beginning with sacred groves like the Lyceum, every garden is a union of this kind: nature separated, bordered, transformed by humans.

But in art and manufacturing alike, the contributions and combinations of nature and humanity are often hidden. For example, trees become timber, ore becomes metal, zooplankton and algae become oil then plastic - they are natural in origin, but no longer "nature". Nature is understood as wilderness, disease, esoteric symbols - as distant "other". Meanwhile, human labour is also invisible: we see products and services, but not necessarily the people who produced them. The garden overcomes this double alientation, by displaying human and natural processes together. Plants and stones remain recognisably plants and stones, but they are arranged, cultivated and maintained artfully. In this, they demonstrate our specific relationship with nature - what me _make_ of it, physically and intellectually.

Nature "hides itself", in that we are creatures of meaning, but the cosmos is literally meaningless.

Aristotle saw nature as something of an organism, full of growth and movement. Plato's nature was a divine blueprint, Epicurus' a random strife of atoms. In this way, nature is a philosophical psonge, which absorbs interpretations. But it never does so perfectly, because each interpretation is partial and derivative - and there is always something _more_, beyond our conceptualisations. 

There is not only nature, but second nature - the first given, the second made. Yet what humanity makes of itself is often unclear and unpredictable.

Like Aristotle's Lyceum, the garden is a companion to the life of the mind.
