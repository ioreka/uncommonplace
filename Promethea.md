"Yet many people only notice the solid world they have been conditioned to think of as more real... While all about them diamond glaciers creak and star-volcanos thunder."
"But what about ideas? Why do some people have better ideas than others?"
"Ideas grow like flowers here. Some are common ideas, found everywhere... But if you want the rarer ideas, the more exotic blossoms, you have to travel further. Artists, scientists, philosophers... They're the pioneers of these territories."
"But you're saying anybody could explore this place if they wanted to?"
"Yes. That's why Promethea's enemies find her so threatening. It's what she represents.
"What do you mean?"
"I mean Jack Faust told you that Promethea was intended to end the world. In a way, he was right. Promethea makes people more aware of this vast immaterial realm. Maybe tempts them to explore it. Imagine if too many people followed where she led? It would be like the great Devonian leap, from sea to land. Humanity slithering up the beach from one element into another. From matter... to mind. We have many names for this event. We call it "The Rapture." We call it "the opening of the 32nd path." We call it the awakening, or the revelation, or the apocalypse. But the end of the world will do."

"It's important that you understand how measureless in power and splendor are the territories which you represent. In truth, the beauties of the solid and material universe are but a part of the rich spectrum of existence. The one-tenth of an iceberg that is visible above the tideline of reality. Matter is that part of being that has crystallized, where the mind's light has petrified to concrete substance. Beyond substance is imagination, the moonlit realm of dream and fiction, sexual fantasy and the unconscious mind. These lunar attributes, imagination and romance, are gem-crusted gateways of the immateria."
"Just the gateway? But I thought dreams and imagination were, like, the whole deal?"
"No. They're just the way in. Beyond the lunar sphere lies the Mercurial domain of intellect and science, of magic and of language. Humankind's most precious gift, communication, has its wellspring here. Still, intellect isn't everything..."
"So, like, the immateria... It's a map of what's inside people, not just the universe beyond them?"
"The worlds inside and outside us have the same structure, the same pattern. Journeying beyond even the intellectual idea of shape or form, we next traverse the rich Venusian landscape of emotion. Passing that, still more rarefied, more tenuous even than feelings, love or joy or sorrow, lie the golden, solar reaches of the human soul. This is the burnished fleck of self within each individual, the highest human plane within the immateria. Beyond lie the transhuman realms of forces absolute and universal."
"Whoah! The weather feels like it's getting rougher!"
"We're moving through the stern and Martial stratospheres of universal judgement, tilting in the very balance of the cosmos. Hold tight, Sophie. Hold tight..."
"Aaa! I'm slipping! Where did all these rain clouds come from?"
"Past universal judgement are the sheltering, Jupiterian skies of universal mercy, where the gods of storm and lightning play. Beyond that is the chasm at the far edge of existence, where... Damn! It's no good, we're tipping over..."
