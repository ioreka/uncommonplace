"Yet many people only notice the solid world they have been conditioned to think of as more real... While all about them diamond glaciers creak and star-volcanos thunder."
"But what about ideas? Why do some people have better ideas than others?"
"Ideas grow like flowers here. Some are common ideas, found everywhere... But if you want the rarer ideas, the more exotic blossoms, you have to travel further. Artists, scientists, philosophers... They're the pioneers of these territories."
"But you're saying anybody could explore this place if they wanted to?"
"Yes. That's why Promethea's enemies find her so threatening. It's what she represents.
"What do you mean?"
"I mean Jack Faust told you that Promethea was intended to end the world. In a way, he was right. Promethea makes people more aware of this vast immaterial realm. Maybe tempts them to explore it. Imagine if too many people followed where she led? It would be like the great Devonian leap, from sea to land. Humanity slithering up the beach from one element into another. From matter... to mind. We have many names for this event. We call it "The Rapture." We call it "the opening of the 32nd path." We call it the awakening, or the revelation, or the apocalypse. But the end of the world will do."
