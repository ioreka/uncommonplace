But there are also things in the countryside whose origins and purpose we have simply forgotten: the constructions and shadows of constructions left to us by our ancestors.

All living organisms have a complexity beyond the scope of any book.

Soils are made, in part at least, from the subsoil. The soil may accumulate other matter - wind-blown particles, organic matter - but it will also lose something through the leaching out of soluble inorganic compounds by rainfall. The chief effect of this is to lower the pH, resulting in a nutrient-poor, acid soil. The purpose of digging out and spreading marl is to bring the subsoil to the top, where it can raise the pH again.

Strip Lynchets are simply terraces on hillsides that were once, and sometimes still are, used for growing arable crops. 

The lush, green rings of grass that are mostly inside the growing ring of mycelium are green because of the nutrients released from organic matter by a fungus - for the most part ammonia, which will form nitrates. The grass further within the ring is sometimes slightly compromised and grows poorly for a while from the disturbance to soil chemistry.

When the subject of Fairy Rings comes up in conversation on a mushroom foray or at a cocktail party, most people express despair at the carnage they wreak on their precious lawns. "How the hell can I get rid of the damn things?" they plead. My answer is that they can't and shouldn't and that I couldn't care less how upset they are.

All tales in the living world exhibit multilayered complexity.

The British countryside is a construct, built by the hand of man over thousands of years. While we accept that truly wild places are rare indeed, we still see our tamed landscape of fields and woods as a thing of beauty. But many of the fields are wastelands of monoculture and the woods recent plantations of introduced trees. Man's interactions with the natural world have not always ended well for our fellow species, but some have been remarkably beneficial to all concerned.

Producing bubbles does not seem like a difficult requirement, but nothing, absolutely nothing, in biology is ever simple.
