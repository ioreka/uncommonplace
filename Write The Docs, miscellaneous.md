Information inherently includes design, whether or not you meant to do it. Information also requires design, no matter how simple and straightforward it may seem.

Knowing where your docs are falling down on the job is a critical first step to being able to improve them. So what can you do to determine where (and with a little luck, why) your documentation isnâ€™t working for your readers? Simple. Test it.

What are the characteristics of a great documentation set? Completeness? Accuracy? Style? Format? No! A great documentation set is one that meets its objectives, and sometimes the barrier to greatness is not dedication, skill, or passion, but a reluctance to let things go. Every document we publish should reach a certain quality threshold - but that threshold varies depending on its audience, the maturity of the project, and the overall project goals. What matters is not that docs are perfect, but that they are _good enough_. #riona-macnamara
