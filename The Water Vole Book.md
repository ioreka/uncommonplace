Rivers are not purely simple lines in the countryside, they are meandering beings that help create a mosaic of wetland habitats. The practice of tidying up rivers needs to be tamed, rivers need to be allowed to express a bit of will, to become a little wilder. Livestock needs to be kept back form the water's edge to stop cattle breaking down the banks, disturbing or destroying water vole nests. Furthermore, until beavers are more common, coppicing in the riparian habitat will generate a far more diverse and abundant ecosystem, benefiting not just water voles but a whole host of other waterside wildlife.

There is a rather glancing reference to the water vole in Evelyn Waugh's satire _Scoop_. So famous is the phrase that it has become a cornerstone in the teaching of nature writing... as how NOT to do it! William Boot notes, in his nature notes column of the _Daily Beast_, 'Feather footed through the plashy fen passes the questing vole.' Purple prose, so easy to get carried away!
