A lot of material exists in the wild about persona development for user experience (UX) teams and audience definition for marketing purposes, but nothing exists for technical documentation, even though every doc team in the world discusses audience all the time.
#audience #writing #narrative 

Information development is a multidimensional discipline, and it’s easy to theorize.
#information-architecture #multidisciplinary-teams 

There is the textbook version of implementing Agile methodology, and then there is the reality. The vast majority of software development teams are using some form of Agile, usually scrum; what they have adopted is a limited or modified version of it.
#agile #work #productivity #relative-correctness 

Most tech writers pride themselves on their commitment to comprehensive documentation. The balance between comprehensive and relevant is important for every writer to consider, but that’s a separate subject from anything the Agile Manifesto seeks to address.
#documentation #compromise 

You, as the documentation writer and customer advocate, will probably need to explain this to your organization. More than once. There is no definition of done without docs. Customer documentation is part of the working software.
#person-centered #allyship

Customer collaboration: A regular customer feedback loop is fundamental to the Agile method. Iterative development without constant customer validation isn’t really Agile.
#agile #continuous-improvement #feedback #growth-mindset #growth 

You don’t need a formal customer feedback program to achieve effective and actionable collaboration.

Quick responses to change are essential. Working in an Agile environment requires continuous development, including continuous documentation development. Change is inevitable. In an Agile environment, especially as a technical writer, you have to have a high tolerance for ambiguity and be ready to adapt to a lot of changes in direction.
#uncertainty #change

For technical writers, being Agile is more about relationship-building than anything else.
#relationships #social-networks #anthropology 

it’s important to remember that scrum isn’t good for everything. There’s plenty of work that isn’t well-suited to Agile methodology. As a technical writer, you know this firsthand. Consider the following types of content that aren’t typically tied to a specific scrum team: Troubleshooting, Release notes, Migration or upgrade information, End-to-end tutorials, Best practices, Some API work
#relative-correctness 

Writers will likely need to participate in multiple scrum teams. As more and more scrum teams form, this can be taxing on the doc team.


As with the direct participation approach, there are challenges to the scrum of writers approach. The most significant challenge is being involved late in the development cycle, which means that writers don’t have opportunities to influence the design of the product or feature to make it more useful or usable.
#preparation 

the lack of writer participation in the development cycle can also lead to inconsistent UI designs, naming conventions, and error messages, all of which will ship as product defects if it’s too late to change them.
#design #user-experience #debt

Writing for multiple scrum teams creates a dilemma. If you attend most or all of the scrum ceremonies, you’ll get the information and team collaboration you need but you’ll have little time to write. If you skip meetings to focus on your docs, you’ll miss out on critical changes and collaboration opportunities.


Every tech writer knows two basic things about our work: We spend only a fraction of our time actually writing. The information development cycle is circular and continuous.
#writing

As technical writers, we talk a lot about audience. Most writers pride themselves on knowing who they’re writing for and advocating for the customer within the product development team.
#audience 

Reliable and accessible documentation requires thorough product knowledge. It also depends equally, if not more, on knowing your audience. Technical writers craft connections between an audience and a product. To build these connections, you need to identify your users as clearly as possible. You also need to identify your users’ goals: the problems they want to solve, the decisions they need to make, or the things they want to build. Equipped with this audience awareness, you can write more accessible, well-situated, and supportive documentation. You can also help create more satisfied customers.
#product #efficiency #decision-making 

Moving toward a clearer and more nuanced sense of who’s reading your documentation can help teams and individual writers in many ways, from figuring out team responsibilities to information architecture, all the way down to editing a sentence.
#linguistics #syntax 

Let it go. The days when technical writers owned their material are over. Nothing is “all yours” anymore. You’re working in a team environment, and whether or not you’re collaborating directly, assignments are fluid—what you work on today could be someone else’s project next month. Remember to be flexible in your personal preferences in order to compromise with other writers. Keep the shared goal in mind: you are building a cohesive product.
#compromise 

Different organizations have different degrees of barriers between documentation teams and customers. Find the path of least resistance and take it. The important thing is to start the conversation and make sure you continue
#conways-law #communication 

If your company does formal surveys, like customer satisfaction or net promoter score, there can be some value to collecting documentation-related metrics as part of that program. It’s more valuable, though, to collect specific feedback and maintain an ongoing conversation with your customers. Surveys that run only a few times a year won’t give you the tangible, actionable feedback you need to improve your content. They also tend to be an extreme lagging indicator.

If you receive negative feedback as a documentation writer, take it seriously, but don’t take it personally.
#feedback

From customer feedback to company success

When we talk about community, we refer to all active users of the product.
#community 

A community refers to the people, connections, and content that lead to better experiences with the product. Working with the community means interacting with users about how they use the product and working with them to achieve solutions. By working with a product’s community, you and other community members contribute to the success of a product, as well as the success of the community itself. 
#the-lived-experience 

When you make documentation decisions, you need to identify the factors or points of information that matter, clearly define the decision that you are making, and introduce a feedback loop to inform your future decisions.
#decision-making #documentation 

you might need to include more tutorial-focused content, diagrams, and glossary content to introduce newer customers to concepts and help them build mental models.

If you’re trying to determine what to work on, product telemetry data can help you identify which features and functionality in the product are most used by customers. 

If you’re too protective of your content and hesitate to expose it unless it meets high-fidelity release standards, you can miss out on valuable feedback from peers and customers. 

Stale documentation happens when writers don’t align themselves with the evolving product and miss out on valuable feedback from beyond their immediate development team.

The more specific you can make your decision, the better. Don’t make a lofty decision, such as, “How do I write the best documentation?” Instead, focus on tangible factors, like, “What three documentation improvements can I make to help my audience?” or “What documentation change can help users who are new to this product?” Always describe the business impact and customer outcome. When your decision is more specific, it makes it easier for you to consider the relevant factors.

However you approach the decisions you need to make, it’s important to focus on the ones that really matter. Think about customer impact, look for opportunities where your efforts can have a multiplying effect, and remember to consider how your decisions affect the people you work with and the decisions that they face.

The job, fundamentally, isn’t about writing or learning technology. It’s a relationship business, more like investigative journalism than anything else.

In today’s documentation world, writers and developers use the same tools and the same project-management methods. Let’s move beyond the stereotypes and recognize that the boundary between writers and developers is thin and permeable.

Research shows that diverse teams—those that feature a variety of experiences, mindsets, abilities, and so on—innovate more, collaborate better, and deliver stronger business outcomes than teams with fewer of these characteristics.
#diversity 

it’s important to consider many aspects of diversity. The aspects that we think about include demographic diversity in all of its many facets, diversity of thought, diversity of personal background, diversity of educational experience, diversity of personal and professional interests, diversity of learning styles, and more.

While many companies correctly emphasize the benefits of inclusion, keep in mind that people in underrepresented groups don’t always want to be included because it can feel like assimilation. People in underrepresented groups might prefer acknowledgment over inclusion. A team of diverse individuals is a strong team only when each member feels that they belong on the team and that everyone values their skills and perspectives. 
#allyship #self 

writers whose work is informed by a range of experiences that span cultural backgrounds, gender orientations, learning styles, abilities and disabilities, and other characteristics are better able to identify with an expanding and changing global technical audience. 

No matter where your team stands in terms of diversity, there’s always room for improvement and growth.

Manage doc team performance in a way that keeps writers focused on innovation, customer interaction, and collaboration. Set goals for these characteristics and reward writers who demonstrate them in tangible ways so that they can serve as examples for the rest of the department and for the product development team as a whole.
#innovation 

The drive to cultivate versatile generalists suffers under the pressures of acquiring deep knowledge about specific technologies.

Every topic needs a learning objective, and it’s best to have one learning objective for a topic. Having one defined objective helps you create modular content and reduces the chance of writing content that overlaps with other documentation.

Topics written without a learning objective are likely to frustrate readers. These topics don’t set clear expectations and users don’t know if they are at a good starting point or if they can even use the content. It’s hard to navigate a topic without direction.

Remember that creating relevant content is more important than creating comprehensive content.

Another benefit to making a documentation plan for big updates is that you can break the project into discrete parts that don’t compromise content stability as you complete each part.

When we think about measurement, we think about precision. This habit of mind arises because we establish our thinking about measurement in terms of the physical world: from construction, cooking, or medicine. In those contexts, we measure precisely because there are physical consequences if we cut the board too short, add too much baking soda, or prescribe the wrong dosage. Measurement in the less-tangible world of business is admirably clarified by Douglas Hubbard. His book, How to Measure Anything, argues eloquently that the purpose of measurement is to reduce uncertainty so that you can make a decision based on the results. In other words, measurement isn’t about precise counting, and measurement has to support a business decision.
#measurement 

Reducing uncertainty is a liberating idea when you think about measurement. You can greatly reduce uncertainty about a question through estimation and small sample sizes. In most cases, doing the extra work required to reach a greater level of precision won’t reduce uncertainty so much more that it is worth the effort.
#uncertainty #data 

There’s potential value in collecting data that is readily available or easy to gather because it might be relevant later or because discovery can be important in and of itself.
#pursuit-of-knowledge 

You might have differing but complementary definitions of success within your department and in how you report to external constituents. Content reuse might be an important metric within your department because you’re interested in resource allocation and consistency while your upper management might be interested in localization savings and ROI on your content management system. Similarly, the productivity metrics that you track for performance management purposes might also be used by your business unit for resource planning.

The very idea of “success” is contextual. You must establish a clear definition of what constitutes success within your department and across your company.
#relative-correctness #linguistic-relativity 

Mark Baker, author of Every Page is Page One, says that mean time to productivity is the only true measurement of whether documentation is successful.

philosophically, he’s right. The true purpose of your documentation is to educate your customer about how to use the product, either while they’re learning about it or using it to do their tasks. The faster your documentation makes your customers productive, the more successful it is.
#success 

A different way to establish the financial value of your documentation is to ask your customers what they think it’s worth.

Although we are counting page views as well as “no” votes, we aren’t using those tallies to mean something on their own. Counting isn’t measurement.
#value

Even small samples can reduce uncertainty. Correlating these two tallies indicates where we can best apply efforts to improve content. Measurement results in action.

Estimating is hard, which means that building a schedule that reflects the realities of cross-functional collaboration is even harder. In companies that have a cultural emphasis on technology development ahead of information development, technical writers can face a schedule squeeze.  The Agile Manifesto doesn’t include docs Since customer-facing documentation often gets mistakenly lumped in with engineering documentation, sometimes people don’t think about docs along the way. Project plans don’t always include milestones for documentation such as knowledge transfer or technical review, epics and stories don’t always include tasks for customer-facing documentation until the last sprint, user stories don’t always detail the minimum viable product per sprint with clear acceptance criteria for docs, the definition of done doesn’t always include testing or reviewing the customer-facing documentation, and so on. Actual writing accounts for a fraction of the time it takes to develop and deliver documentation, but in many cases, documentation is a single line item in a project plan, backlog, or Agile board. With this simplified view of the actual work, the project plan doesn’t accurately account for the documentation schedule. See Chapter 2, “Agile”, for more information. Sprints aren’t universal Software developers work in two-week sprints, marketers
#productivity #time #organisation 

An engineer might tell you that an upcoming change is a minimal amount of work, so the documentation shouldn’t take long to complete. This isn’t always the case if there are screenshots, diagrams, tutorials, or product name changes that need revision throughout the entire documentation set.

The customer rarely needs to know every implementation detail about every feature.

Remember that your team members aren’t just cogs in a machine. People are often more willing to participate when you recognize them for their contributions. Congratulate each other on small victories along the way.

The question to ask when deciding whether to explain implementation is, “Why do they need to know?”

Consider doing nothing Omit implementation details unless there are user-facing consequences. When confronted with oddities, see if the product can address them. Be honest but discreet.

Can it go in the UI? Users prefer using the product, and recourse to the documentation is a distant second choice for them. If you find yourself documenting an elaborate and manual process, ask whether it can be automated on behalf of the user.
#user-experience #writing #automation

Grammar-checking tools can be great for validating punctuation and spelling, but they can’t provide feedback on the effectiveness of a piece of documentation.
#syntax #linguistics 

Technical editing brings perspective, quality, consistent style, and principles of good information design to documentation.

When technical writing is clear, readers can find the information they need to succeed in their tasks and solve their problems. The quality of the content in your documentation set can also earn the trust of customers by not having too many distracting typos, grammar mistakes, inconsistent terminology, and inconsistently formatted text.

Writing is hard. Writing well is even harder. Writing well consistently is even harder than that. Having multiple writers writing well consistently with a consistent style is the hardest of all. 

Readability is hard to review for, and it’s especially hard to review for when you’re self-editing. Reading your content out loud can help you identify general wordiness, phrases that might trip up readers, or sentences that might not bring a lot of value to the topic.

The editors on the Splunk doc team respect that writers in the tech industry are more than wordsmiths. They are information gatherers, detectives seeking to understand user workflows, product testers, document designers, and the voice between the company’s product and its audience. We understand the breadth of the writer’s role, we know that there are considerable constraints on their time, and we trust them to make informed decisions about their content, what information is the most useful to the customer, and what presentation of that information works best. The Splunk editors seek to collaborate with writers by offering objective feedback and to edit without judgment. Splunk doc writers come from a range of education backgrounds and work experiences, and we believe these diversities makes us a better team.

Continuous feedback leads to continuous improvement.

Feedback is data. If you get feedback from editing, you get data that can help you make decisions about your writing, such as what content to keep and what to remove, what wording best resonates with your audience, and what style is consistent with the larger body of documentation for your company. In this age of data-driven decisions, it’s always the right time to get feedback.

The short and sweet writer checklist Here is the “list of seven”—the top items writers must address in their content every time they touch a topic: Create descriptive headings. Use the correct product names. Put procedures in task steps, not in paragraphs.  Use short, understandable sentences.  Write in present tense. Write in active voice as much as possible and remove passive voice. Avoid possessives.

Technical review is not a one-time event. Rather, verifying the validity of your documentation must be an ongoing and never-ending process.

The review begins when you start investigating a feature, and it continues to the point when the feature, and its documentation, are released to customers. But even then, you must continue to validate your material as you receive new information, customer and internal feedback, logged bugs, and more. Both the product and its documentation live for a long time in the sustaining phase of their life cycle.

Tempting as it is, never offer reviewers cookies or other bribes. The tendency among some writers to plead for reviews as if they were asking for something beyond the norm of the reviewers’ responsibilities is unprofessional, unseemly, and counterproductive. It inevitably makes the review process more difficult in the future for both the writer and the other writers on your team.

There’s no way to recommend a specific content delivery tool, authoring platform, or content management system without knowing a pile of information about what the information deliverables need to do and how a doc team intends to operate.

There are a great many variables that feed into the decision about the technologies you use to write, edit, publish, and maintain your documentation.
#technology 

Reader usability Arguably, the most important things to consider stem from the experience your customers have with product documentation.

Ultimately, when it comes to evaluating documentation platforms, begin with the end in mind.

The internet has a lot to say about documentation using a wiki. For every good thing that a wiki does, someone is quick to point out where a wiki falls short.

At Splunk, all employees can edit the documentation. When we mention that to many tech writers, they look a little pale and shaky. Perhaps they’re imagining a management directive handed down to them: “We’re a collaborative company! Just imagine how up-to-the-minute our product documentation will be! Anyone can add content so surely everyone will contribute!” They entertain fearful thoughts of chaotic information architecture, duplicate content, circular logic, long-winded diatribes in the form of knowledge articles, and a manifest ignorance of the finer points of grammar and clear writing. Further, this anxiety extends into what has been referred to as content ROT (redundant, obsolete, and trivial). If everyone owns content creation, then no one owns it, right? And if no one owns it, no one will validate it, update it, curate it, or kill it when necessary.
#product #care 

To be a good technical writer, you have to understand the mental model that your engineers have and speak the same language they use. No matter how well you understand the customer and use case, if you lack the knowledge and technical skill to have a substantive, collaborative, peer conversation with engineers, you’re going to be marginalized in the project team and the quality of your content will suffer. In the best case, you will turn into a copyeditor who polishes what engineers give you. In the worst case, they will dismiss or ignore you entirely, and you’ll be forced to document something you don’t understand without meaningful access to useful information from the people who built it.

Exercise your own knowledge to help shape the product. If the product is docs and docs are the product, then you are a designer, a developer, and a product manager, too.

Engineers are unlikely to interact with customers at regular intervals. Some engineers work with customers on specific support case escalations, but this is a limited interaction and it doesn’t happen all that often. When engineers build a product, their understanding of the customer comes from product managers and other stakeholders. You, as a documentarian, play an important role in helping engineers understand their customers through your own direct customer contact and the alliances you build with the field.

integrated content experience

The product’s users usually get their first introduction to product features from marketing or other presales content. As a documentation team, you want their transition from the marketing content to the documentation content to be seamless, cohesive, and logical.

acceptance criteria Part of the core responsibility of a product manager is to understand customers and to translate their business needs into product goals.

The fact is, sometimes our UX design and engineering teams turn out products that fail the customer, even when they’re functioning exactly as designed.

If you see something, say something: the writer’s role as user advocate
