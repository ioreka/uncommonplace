My approach in trying to answer such questions is essentially the one expressed by the motto of the Royal Society, _nullius in verba_ (Latin for "take nobody's word for it"). That is, I always start by going back to the scientific literature to try and find some actual evidence; I am not (or only rarely anyway) particularly interested in airing my own opinions.

Birds are like people. At least, when it comes to choosing a congenial urban neighbourhood to live in, birds and people share remarkably similar tastes. Ecologists have known for 50 years that many birds like a layered, semi-wooded landscape. That is, they like well-spaced trees, with plenty of smaller trees, shrubs and herbaceous vegetation in the gaps between the big trees; essentially plants at every level from the ankles upwards. The reason is simple - this multi-layered vegetatation is best at providing everything birds want out of life: food, nesting sites, protection from predators, and somewhere to perch and sing. 
At the same time, students of the human condition have shown that this kind of landscape - wooded but not too wooded, partly open, partly shady, diverse, and above all, _interesting_ - appeals to people too. The measure of that appeal is simple: we are prepared to pay more for houses surrounded by that sort of landscape. Not for nothing is the "leafy suburb" the standard cliche for a desirable place to live, unless you're allergic to gardening, or too poor to affort a gardener. Partly that's because to the human eye it looks just right, but we probably also realise, perhaps only subconsciously, that such landscapes also deliver a range of benefits: reduced noise, wind, dust and air pollution, better rainwater management and less need for air conditioning in the summer.

So the take-home message is that as far as plant origin is concerned, it doesn't matter what you grow, but the ideal is a good mixture of natives and near natives, with a few exotics thrown in to extend the slowering season. The final good news is that studies of British gardens show that this is exactly what most of us are doing already, so we can just carry on as we are.

Anyone who has ever grown buddleia will not need telling that plants don't need to be native to attract lots of pollinators.

Science isn't about knowing all the answers, it's about asking the interesting questions.

The beauty of compost is that nature has been turning green waste into compost for at least 400 million years, and needs almost no encouragement from you to go on doing it. You don't even need a bin, other than for the sake of tidiness. All you really need is patience - given enough of that, anyone will make compost in the end.

Gardens _are_ dangerous places, for the unwary, but the things you need to worry about are the usual - and very mundane - suspects, such as lawnmovers, hedgetrimmers, shears, secateurs, bamboo canes, garden forks and hoses. Over 5,000 people are injured every year by flowerpots, but the biggest danger by far is just falling over.

Believe me, life is to short to even attempt to summarise the arguments for why (a) there are too many hyphens in plant names, and (b) they are in the wrong place. Granted, hyphens are illogical (in the official Wildflower Society life, why wild-oat for _Avena fatua_ but water fern for _Azolla_?), but if we wanted logic, we'd all be speaking Esperanto. There is no more doomed enterprise than trying to rationalise something that neither needs nor wants to be rationalised. Whatever I or anyone else sayd, hyphens will continue to appear where centuries of custom and practice dictate, and there's an end to the matter/

Nor are these healthy soils any barrier to high yields. During the Second World War 'Dig for Victory' campaign, allotments and gardens provided around 10% of food consumed in the UK, despite covering less than 1% of the area of arable cultivation. Recent research also shows that gardens and allotments produce yields of fruit and vegetables four to eleven times greater than conventional agricultural crops. In fact, soil organic matter is now so low beneath many agricultural soils that it makes it increasingly hard to maintain high crop yields.

The policy lessons are clear, but I'll spell them out anyway. Encouraging people to grow their own food simultaneously targets food security, improves the well-known (physical and psychological) health benefits of gardening, and helps to reducce climate change, flooding, pollution and erosion. You seriously want to save the planet? Give us the tools, and the land, and we - gardeners - will do it for you.

This is no joke: the growing, transportation, packaging, retailing and cooking of food, together with the clearing of land to grow food in the first place, accounts for as much as 30% of the UK's carbon footprint.

A key consideration, not surprisingly, is yield - all things being equal, you're better off growing high-yielding crops than low-yielding ones. So courgettes, for example, which are both high-yielding and almost entirely imported, are a good choice. But yield isn't everything: potatoes are almost all grown in the UK and their carbon footprint is small, so little is gained (in CO2 terms) by growing your own. Sometimes yield outweighs other concerns. So alsothough it takes a lot of energy (and therefore CO2 emissions) to manufacture a greenhouse or polytunnel, the much higher yield of greenhouse-grown tomatoes more than compensates for that. Tomatoes are also mostly imported, and even those grown in the UK mostly come from heated greenhouses that use a lot of energy.
Sometimes the CO2 emissions from transport are of primary importance. Exhibit A here is green beans, which are imported year-round in large quantities by the UK from outside Europe, mostly from Kenya. Only in mid- to late summer do UK-grown beans make a dent in our imports. Because the beans are imported by air, their carbon footprint is huge, making it very worthwhile to grow your own. Here, however, the arguments start to get more complicated. First, "CO2-saving" depends on the assumption that your own produce directly substitutes for (imported) produce from the supermarket. But if you care about your carbon footprint, maybe you wouldn't consider  buying beans freighted from Africa in the first place? In which case, your CO2 saving is more notional, and depends on the carbon footprint of what you _would_ eat (if you weren't growing your own). Plus, there's always the difficulty of the welfare of the 2 million Kenyans who depend on us to buy their fruit, flowers and vegetables. 
But if we grow all the right things, how well are we doing, relatively speaking? That all depends on what you choose to compare it with. Planting trees soaks up CO2, but growing your own fruit and veg does much better, in fact about 10 times better, than planting trees on the same land. On the other hand, most of the emissions of CO2 (and other greenhouse gases) from food come from the production and consumption of meat and dairy products. If you gave up eating meat, or significantly reduced your consumption, your carbon footprint would be greatly improved, almost irrespective of where your fruit and veg came from.
#gardening 

Nearly all our vitamins and other essential nutrients from from bee-pollinated plants.

The flowers of one Malaysian palm contains yeasts that turn nectar into 3.8% alcohol, and the tree-shrews that pollinate the palm spend their lives in a permanent state of inebriation.

As the late, great Miles Kington put it, "Knowldge is knowing that tomatoes are fruits; wisdom is knowing not to put them in fruit salads".

In other words, there is no operational definition of "wildness" or "gardenness", nothing about a plant you can measure to determine its degree of wildness. And, as a general principle, all such unmeasurable categories should be treated with deep suspicion. "Native" and "alien" is another good example, and worst of all, "fashionable" and "unfashionable".

So, do "wildflowers thrive in poor soil"? No, not really, any more than you or I would thrive on a diet of bread and water. A better way to look at it is that wildflowers don't like poor soils very much, but the grasses that would like to overwhelm them like them even less.

After all, a self-seeded plant has chosen where it would like to grow, and it's probably a better judge of that than you are.

For centuries, one of the surest ways of signalling to the reader that a character is a bit of a twerp is to make him (usually him) a gardener, and the keener the gardener, the bigger the twerp.

Returning to the demands of literature, TV and cinema, you also can't get away from the fact it's hard to make gardening even slightly perilous; "down these mean streets a man must go" is fair enough, but "mean allotments" or "mean herbaceous borders" just doesn't cut it. Indeed, in my experience gardeners are among the most laid-back, generous, serene and above all tolerant people you could hope to meet.

In other wods, looking at flowers (a key aspect of gardening, although of course usually preceded by growing them) increases the stock of human happiness and generosity and thus, I submit, happiness in general. And you can't ask for more than that, can you?i
