Critical thinking requires assembling data to back up one's opnion. Otherwise students may falsely conclude that all opinions are somehow equal.

Textbooks stifle meaning by suppressing causation. Students exit history textbooks without having developed the ability to htink coherently about social life.

Cultures do not evolve in a vacuum; diffusion of ideas is perhaps the most important cause of cultural development. Contact with other cultures often triggers a cultural flowering. Anthropologists call this syncretism: combining ideas from two or more cultures to form something new.

Europe's fascination with the Americas was directly responsible, in fact, for a rise in European self consciousness. From the beginning America was perceived as an "opposite" to Europe in ways that even Africa had never been. In a sense, there was no "Europe" before 1492. People were simply Tuscan, French, and the like. Now Europeans began to see seimilarities among themselves, at least as contrasted with Native Americans. For that matter, there were no "white" people in Europe before 1492. With the transatlantic slave trade, first Indian, then African, Europeans increasingly saw "white" as a race and race as an important human characteristic.
