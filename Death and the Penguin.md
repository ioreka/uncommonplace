Life was a road, and if departed from at a tangent, the longer for it. And a long road was a long life - a case where travel was better than to arrive, the point of arrival being, after all, always the same: death.

He had, it seemed, divined the secret of longevity. Longevity depended on peace. Peace was the source of self-assurance, and self-assurance allowed one to cleanse one's life of needless upsets, twists and turns. Self-assurance allowed one to take decisions for the prolonging of one's life. Self-assurance led to the future.
