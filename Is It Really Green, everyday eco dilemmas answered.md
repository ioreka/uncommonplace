While the Covid-19 pandemic has been a wake-up call for some, making us more thoughtful about what we buy, who we buy it from, and whether we need to buy at all, overconsumption remains our society's overriding issue.

None of us were born knowing what to do; we've had to learn, often going against behaviours ingrained in our upbringing. While most of us have financial limits, and we're all short of time, we can still make changes. If I can do it, so can you. 

Going green means making small changes that build into big shifts in social behaviour - look how quickly we ditched unnecessary plastic straws, or paused our travel in lockdown. Together we can exert pressure on those above us, be they global brands or governments. Don't despair, and don't give up. 

Studies suggest that you would need to read around 25 ebooks a year for the energy and materials used to produce the e-reader to hae less environmental impact than the same number of printed books. 

The world is warmer now than it has ever been in the last 2000 years. In 2021, there is no other way to look at the situation than as an emergency that affects everyone on earth, and every generation to come.

Forests currently cover around 30% of the Earth's land area, but they are disappearing fast. Worldiwde, we lose an area of ancient woodlandequivalent to the size of the UK every year. In the last 50 years, 17% of the Amazon rainforest has been cut down. As well as destroying the habitats of indigenous peoples, deforestation has a profound effect on the climate. Trees act as "carbon sinks", absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and holding onto it for decades or centuries. 

Simply planting new trees isn't the answer - it would take decades for them to become as effective at storing carbon as the diverse ecosystems of rainforests or mangroves being lost.

Not only does healthy soil grow nutritious food, it also locks in three times more carbon than is in our atmosphere, prevents flooding, and cleans rainwater as it permeates through underground freshwater systems. 

Every time you spend money, you vote for the future you want to see. Global brands might seem like they're in charge, but their success depends on your support.

You can't solve everything, so pick something. Be kind. Be brave. Be bold. Our planet needs you.

When food ends up in landfill it doesn't break down efficiently. Food waste requires both light and oxygen to decompose, both of which are lacking in landfill. Instead, the food breaks down very slowly, and in the process releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

With an estimated one third of the food produced globally going uneaten, the issue of food waste is of serious concern. Wasting food means wasting resources, including the energy and water that is used to produce and transport it. The amount of food that goes uneaten every year requires a land mass larger than china to grown. 

The impact of the dairy industry shouldn't be underestimated. In the US, almost one-fifth of the agricultural water supply is used in reading 9 million dairy cows; in the UK, a staggering 13 billion eggs are consumed in a year. In addition, the enormous farms that are often needed to supply these products gobble up hue amounts of power, animal feed, and antibiotics, with their associated airmiles - representing millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions. 

Beef and lamb are the worst offenders when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. Together, these two animals produce more methane than all other types of livestock combined. 
]Native, lighter-footed animals (such as deer) that don't compact the soil so much as heavy cattle can also be more sustainable. Less compacted soil means more water absorption, which helps mitigate the risk of flooding.

At least 75% of all soya produced goes to feed industrially farmed livestock. Only a small amount is eaten by humans.

Halving Europe's meat consumption would cut soymeal use by 75%.

It takes over 3 litres of water to grow a single almond.

Buying a bag of organic potatoes might not seem like the most revolutionary act, but every little action supports a community of people forging ways forward to create a greener world. More demand for organic products will lead to a decrease in the amount of land that's industrially farmed, polluted, and stripped of wildlife.

It takes up to 170 litres of water to make just 0.5 litres of carbonated drink - in a world where 785 million people don't have access to clean water. 

If you are discerning when eating out, ensuring that your consumer power supports restaurants that are striving for sustainability, it becomes harder for less eco-friendly establishments to carry on ignoring the issues we're facing. By choosing thoughtfully, you can have a say in the ingredients that your favourite restaurants use - and since ingredients are responsible for the largest portion of a restaurant's carbon footprint, making them greener is an effective way to shrink that footprint. 

10 billion plastic tampon applicators are thrown away every month worldwide.

The world gets through 1.3 billion wet wipes a day, and each one takes 100 years or more to biodegrade.

For every ethical choice, there's often a further concequence. No material has zero impact.

The irony is that sequinned clothes are often the items we get the least wear out of, yet all that plastic will be around for centuries to come. [...] You can still be fabulous without shiny bits of plastic.

It takes 3000 litres of water just to make one cotton shirt.

The UK gets through 227,000 miles of wrapping paper every christmas.

You'd have to use a fake tree for 10 years before it became more energy efficient than using a real tree each year, but even then you're left, at the end of its life, with a tree that does not decompose.

When a firework goes off it releases carbon dioxide and very fine dust particles of metals and other toxins, which pollute the air and are hamful to health. In the US, fireworkks give off over 60,000 tonnes of CO2 a year.

The substances in fireworks - sulphur, potassium nitrate, and charcoal - pollute not only the air but also the waterways over which they are often exploded, harming aquatic life. The metallic elements, added for colour, seep into soil, building up the acidity, which in turn affects the health of plants and animals. And on top of that, fireworks are often covered in plastic casing which, once blown up, remains in the soil and water as microplastics.

A garden can become a microcosm of eco-friendly practices.

Concrete in particular is an eco-nightmare: the immense global scale of its production uses so much energy that if the cement industry were a country, it would rank third in the world for carbon emissions.

Many of the environmental problems associated with the production and distribution of food worldwide can be alleviated on a small, personal scale by growing your own food. Food grown at home has no airmiles or packaging. It can also be cultivated organically, without the use of intensive chemical input. And, since you've put in the hard work and heart into helping it grow, you're less likely to waste it than shop-bought food. 

The most eco-friendly gardens are those that produce food. Anyone who has a green space - even a balcony or a few plant pots - can do it.

With just 4 crops (soya beans, wheat, rice, and corn) accounting for 50% of all the food grown globally, most industrial agriculte doesn't encourage the biodiversity promoted by permaculture. The small gene pool of commercial crops also makes them vulnerable to prest and disease can wipe out vast swathes of crops.

For every 100 people who work from home twice a week, an estimated 63.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions are avoided annually.

We're only just beginning to understand the carbon cost of the ever-more enormous and power-hungry data centres that house our online content and "cloud" storage. It's estimated that the energy usage of data centres will account for 3% of all carbon emissions by 2025, as our increasingly digital lives require yet more storage and processing power. By 2040, if current trends continue, storing our digital data will account for 14% of global emissions - the equivalent CO2 impact of the entire US today. 

The upkeep of pristine golf greens means that an average golf course uses 189 million litres of water a year (the same amount would serve a village of 1400 people for a year).

In the Us, for example, keeping pets is thought to contribute 64 million tonnes of CO2 and methane to the environment each year. That's the equivalent of putting about 13.6 million cars on the roads.
