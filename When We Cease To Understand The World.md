Alarmed by the manic fervour of his academic output, his colleagues advised him to slow down, fearing that his inner fire would consume him. Schwatzschild paid them no attantion. Physics was not enough for him. He aspired to the type of knowledge the alchemists had pursued, and laboured beneath the sway of a strange urgency that not even he could fully explain: "Often I have been unfaithful to the heavens. My interest has never been limited to things situated in space, beyond the moon, but has rather followed those threads woven between them and the darkest zones of the human soul, as it is there that the new light of science must be shone."

If matter were prone to birthing monsters of this kind, Schwatzchild asked with a trembling voice, were there correlations with the human psyche? Could a sufficient concentration of human will - millions of people exploited for a single end with their minds compressed into the same psychic space - unleash something comparable to the singularity?

"If a mere particle of dust contains billions of atoms," Bohr said to [Heisenberg] as they were scaling the massifs of the Harz range, "what possible way is there to talk meaningfully of something so small?" The physicist - like the poet - should not describe the facts of the world, but rather generate metaphors and mental connections. From that summer onwards, Heisenberg understood that to apply concepts of classical physics such as position, velocity and momentum to a subatomic particle was sheer madness. That aspect of nature required a completely new language.

According to the determinists, if one could reveal the laws that goverened matter, one could reach back into the most archaic past and predict the most distant future. If everything that occurred was the direct consequence of a prior state, then merely by looking at the present and running the equations it would be possible to achieve a godlike knowledge of theuniverse. These hopes were shattered by Heisenberg's discovery: what was beyond our grasp was neither the future nor the past, but the present itself.Not even the state of one miserable particle could be perfectly apprehended. However much we scrutinized the fundamentals, there would always be something vague, undetermined, uncertain, as if reality allowed us to perceive the world with crystalline clarity with one eye at a time, but never with both.

Grothendieck: "What stimulates me is not ambition or the thirst for power. It is the acute perception of something immense and yet very delicate at the same time."

Like the moon in Buddhism, a particle does not exists: it is the act of measuring that makes it a real object.

Grothendieck: "A perspective is by nature limited. It offers us one single vision of a landscape. Only when complementary views of the same reality combine are we capable of achieving fuller access to the knowledge of things. The more complex the object we are attempting to apprehend, the more important it is to have different sets of eyes, so that these rays of light converge and we can see the One through the many. That is the nature of true visionL it brings together already known points of view and shows others hitherto unknown, allowing us to understand that all are, in actuality, part of the same thing."
