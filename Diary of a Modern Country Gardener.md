We are all so shocked when we lose a mature plant, but they are living things. Yours might just have had enough of this world. Gardens are ever-evolving and that's a good thing.

If you use a few organic slug pellets now (Valentine's Day) around emerging vulnerable plants, you will kill off the first generation of slugs. When you know that a slug or snail will breed about four times in a year and lay as many as 350 eggs in one year, it's no wonder that gardeners are frantically throwing the slimy beasts over their neighbours' hedges in May. Leave this job until spring and you've missed the boat.

After all, when it comes to gardening there is usually more than one correct answer to a question anyway.

I don't mind the silence; I've grown to quite like my own company. Gardening alone gives you plenty of time to think and look at plants and wildlife more carefully. In the drama of summer it's easy to miss out on the small but important details of a garden.

If I were a millionare and money were no object, I would have young broad beas on tap, alpaca socks and salted Lurpack butter to melt over the beans. Life's simple pleasures.

I can't tell you how often I've heard, "We won't come into the garden today as there won't be anything in flower yet," as a visitor heads to the cafe for a large slice of cake. I have decided that some people see beauty and others don't. Some do not see the wonders of nature and manage to just pass through unaffected whilst others are moved by discovering emerging plants and dainty flowers. Those that see are the lucky ones. Not, of course, that there's anything wrong with enjoying cake!

As I walked the pavements of gold in Kensington in my steel toecaps, for a moment I considered life as a city-dweller. Constant, reliable wifi; fabulous cafes and posh restaurants; swanky cars. But here, sitting at my wobbly kitchen table with the garden door flung open and birdsong driftnig in, I know that this is definitely home.

Talking gardens is enjoyable and more importantly it's healthy - far better than gossipping about neighbours, other people's children or common ailments.

We all keep our homes in different ways, so it confuses me that gardeners think a plot must be kept completely weed-free. A garden should reflect our personalities, lifestyles, location and time restraints. It is therefore completely acceptable to have weeds if you want them.

Seeds represent hope. However old and wise you get, the joy of watching something that looks as if it belongs in a new funky brand of herbal tea transform into something, in some cases, large enough to stand under, never gets less exciting.

It's sowing seed that gets most of us into gardening in the first place. The desire to babysit actual children might fade with age but the desire to grow from seed only increases.

(Raking leaves) might seem a thankless task, but I've decided that the joy of gardening is not so much what you do but what you see whilst doing it.
