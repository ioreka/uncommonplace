One's own dead are more than cadavers, they are placeholders for the living. They are a focus, a receptacle, for emotions that no longer have one. The dead of science are always strangers.

Cadavers occasionally affect a soft of accidental humanness that catches the medical professional off guard.

A cow carcass is upsetting; a brisket is dinner.

The anonymity of body parts facilitates the necessary dissociations of cadaveric research: This is not a person. This is just tissue. It has no feelings, and no one has feelings for it.

Placing the heart center stage in our definition of death served to give it, by proxy, a starring role in our defition of life and the soul, or spirit or self. [...] The concept of the beating-heart cadaver, grounded in a belief that the self resides in the brain and the brain alone, delivered a philosophical curveball. The notion of the heart as fuel pump took some getting used to.

We are all products of our upbringing, our culture, our need to confirm.

I guess this is how it is with animal careers. If you deal with animals for a living, you generally also deal with their deaths.

To a certain extent, of course, dignity is in the packaging. When you get right down to it, there is no dignified way to go, be it decomposition, incineration, dissection, tissue digestion, or composting. They're all, bottom line, a little disagreeable. It takes the careful application of a well-considered euphemism - burial, cremation, anatomical gift-giving, water reduction, ecological funeral - to bring it to the point of acceptance.

(Evans) envisions families planting a tree or shrub, which would take up the deceased's molecules and become a living memorial. "This is as close," he said to me, "as science is going to get to reincarnation."

Wiigh-Masak's point: We are all nature, made of the same basic materials, with the same basic needs. We are no different, on a very basic level, from the ducks and the mussels and last week's coleslaw. Thus we should respect Nature, and when we die, we should give ourselves back to the earth.

It's gory, but it's not sad. Gore you get used to. Shattered lives you don't.

The distance between the very old, sick, frail person and the dead one is short, with a poorly marked border. The more time you spend with the invalid elderly (I have seen both my parents in this state), the more you come to see extreme old age as a gradual easing into death.
