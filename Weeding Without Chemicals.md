Almost every spoonful of soil has enough seeds in it to cover a very large area with growing things.

Masses of stinging nettles are almost always a sign of old human habitations, as they love the rich sites made by our relentless dumping of garbage and waste. In East Anglia, the angelica-like alexanders is a rare roadside weed found only near old Roman habitation sites. Many docks indicate that a field has probably been used for pasturing horses, as the seeds pass through a horse undigested, or it may, of course, just show that the soil had some horse manure applied to it.

Weeds are the way in which nature heals the green covering of this earth. Many are re-coverers when a bare piece of soil appears: as after a landfall, when a large tree is uprooted, a mole hill, a badger or rabbit digs a den, or when a shallow wet area becomes muddy and dry. All these bits of loose earth need fixing to stop the soil washing or blowing away.

Thus, much of gardening is really about arresting nature's inevitable progression.

A weed is, indeed, well-defined as a plant in the wrong place. One cannot put it better. In another spot or time, the same plant would be a native benefiting insect life, a ground stabiliser, a nutrient recycler or even a garden flower, but right now, where it is, it is unwanted, thus a weed.
