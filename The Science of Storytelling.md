We experience our day-to-day lives in story mode.

Still, today, modern nations are principally defined by the stories we tell ourselves about our collective selves: our victories and defeats; our heroes and foes; our distinctive values and ways of being, all of which are encoded in the tales we tell and enjoy.

Story is what brain does. It is a 'story processor', writes the psychologist Professor Jonathan Haidt, 'not a logic processor'

The storytellers and the scientists had started off in completely different places and had ended up discovering the same things.

I suspect it's this belief in plot as a magic formula that's responsible for the clinical feel from which modern stories sometimes suffer. But a plot can never work in isolation. This is why I believe the focus on plot should be shifted onto character. It's people, not events, that we're naturally interested in.

I agree with novelist and teacher of creative writing John Gardner, who argues that 'the most supposed aesthetic absolutes prove relative under pressure'

A birth may be the beginning of a life and, if the brain was a data processor, that's surely where our tale would start. But raw biological data have little meaning to the storytelling brain.

Change is endlessly fascinating to brains. 'Almost all perception is based on the detection of change', says the neuroscientist Professor Sophie Scott. 'Our perceptual systems basically don't work unless there are changes to detect.'

That 1.2kg lump of greyish-pink computational jelly you keep between your ears might fit comfortably in two cupped hands but, taken at its own scale, it's vast beyond comprehension. You have 86 billion brain cells or 'neurons' and every one of them is a complex as a city. Signals flow between them at speeds of us to 120 metres per second. They travel along 150000-180000 kms of synaptic wiring, enough to wrap around the planet four times.

Unexpected change is a portal through which danger arrives to swipe at our throats. Paradoxically, however, change is also an opportunity. It's the crack in the universe through which the future arrives. Change is hope. Change is promise. It's our winding path to a more successful tomorrow. When unexpected change strikes we want to know, what does it mean? Is this change for the good or the bad? Unexpected change makes us curious, and curious is how we should feel in the opening movements of an effective story.

In life, most of the unexpected changes we react to will turn out to be of no importance: the bang was just a lorry door; it wasn't your name, it was a mother calling for her child. So you slip back into the reverie and the world, once more, becomes a smear of motion and noise. But, every now and then, that change matters. It forces us to act. This is when story begins.

Brains, concluded the researchers, seem to become spontaneously curious when presented with an 'information set' they realise is incomplete. 'There is a natural inclination to resolve information gaps,' wrote Lowenstein, 'even for questions of no importance.'

This is how it works. You walk into a room. Your brain predicts what the scene should look and sound and feel like, then it generates a hallucination based on these predictions. It's this hallucination that you experience as the world around you. It's this hallucination that you exist at the centre of, ever minute of every day. You'll never experience _actual_ reality because you have no direct access to it. 'Consider that whole beautiful world around you, with all its colours and sounds and smells and textures,' writes the neuroscientist and fiction writer Professor David Eagleman. 'Your brain is not directly experiencing any of that. Instead, your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull.'

There's no colour out there either. Atoms are colourless. All the colours we do 'see' are a blend of three cones that sit in the eye: red, green and blue. This makes us _Homo sapiens_ relatively impoverished members of the animal kingdom: some birds have six cones; mantis shrimp have _sixteen_; bees' eyes are able to see the electromagnetic structure of the sky. The colourful worlds they experience beggar human imagination. Even the colour we do 'see' are mediated by culture. Russians are raised to see two types of blue and, as a result, see eight-striped rainbows. Colour is a lie. It's set-dressing, worked up by the brain.

Dreams feel real because they're made of the same hallucinated neural models we live inside when we're awake.

How reading works: Brains take information from the outside world - in whatever form they can - and turn it into models. When our eyes scan over letters in a book, the information they contain is converted into electrical pulses. The brain reads these electrical pulses and builds a model of whatever information those letters provided. So if the words on the page describe [...] a ten-foot wizard with his knees on back to front, the train will model a ten-foot wizard with his knees on back to front. Our brain rebuilds the model world that was originally imagined by the author of the story. This is the reality of Leo Tolstoy's brilliant assertion that 'a real work of art destroys, in the consciousness of the receiver, the separation between himself and the artist.'

According to Bergen, we start modelling  words as soon as we start reading them. We don't wait until we get to the end of the sentence. This means the order in which writers place their words matters. This is perhaps my transitive construction - _Jane gave a kitten to her dad_ - is more effective than the ditransitive - _Jane gave her dad a kitten_. Picturing Jane, then the kitten, then her dad mimics the real-world action that we, as readers, should be modelling. It means we're mentally experiencing the scene in the correct sequence. Because writers are, in effect, generating neural movies in the minds of their readers, they should privilege word order that's filmic, imagining how their reader's neural camera will alight on each component of a sentence.

The hallucinated world our brain creates for us is specialised. It's honed towards our particular survival needs. Like all animals, our species can only detect the narrow band of reality that's necessary for us to get by. Dogs live principally in a world of smell, moles in touch and knife-fish in a realm of electricity. The human world is predominantly that of people. Our hyper-social brains are designed to control an environment of other selves.

Scientists used to believe attention was drawn simply to objects that stood out, but recent research suggests we're more likely to attend to that which we find meaningful.

We think of the act of 'seeing' as the simple detection of colour, movement and shape. But we see with our pasts.
#perception 

These worlds of feeling are a result of the way our brains encode the environment. The models we have of everything are stored in the form of neural networks. 

Human memory is 'episodic' (we tend to experience our messy pasts as a highly simplified sequence of causes and effects) and 'autobiographical' (those connected episodes are imbued with personal and moral meaning).

When posed with even the deepest questions about reality, human brains tend toward story. What is a modern religion if not an elaborate neocortical 'theory and explanation about what's happening in the world and why'?
#religion 

With each new development an information gap opens up which creates a new tantalising  yearning for what's coming next. This is how best-selling page-turners and blockbusting scripts generate their addictive force. They have a relentless adherence to forward motion, one thing leading to another, and exploit our quenchless curiosity for fuel.
#curiosity 

Good stories are explorations of the human condition; thrilling voyages into foreign minds.

Identifying and accepting our flaws, and then changing who we are, means breaking down the _very structure of our reality_ before rebuilding it in a new and improved form. This is not easy. It's painful and disturbing.

These micro-narratives of cause and effect - more commonly known as 'beliefs' - are the building blocks of our neural realm.

Locked within the black vault of our skulls, stuck forever in the solitude of our own hallucinated universe, story is a portal, a hallucination within the hallucination, the closest we'll ever come to escape.

Such cultural norms are incorporated into our models in childhood, a period in which the brain is rapidly working out who it needs to be in order to best control its particular environment. Between the ages of zero and two, it generates around 1.8 million neural connections a second. It remains in this state of increased malleability (plasticity) until late adolescence or early adulthood. It learns, in part, through playing.
#neuroplasticity 

For the Greeks, the primary agent of self control was the individual. For the Chinese, it was the group. For the Greeks, reality was made up of individual pieces and parts. For the Chinese, it was a field of interconnected forces. Out of these differences in reality come different story forms.

We rewrite and even invent our own pasts.

Researchers have found that violence and cruelty has 4 general causes: greed and ambition; sadism; high self-esteem, and moral idealism. Popular belief and cliched stories tend to have it that greed and sadism are dominant. In fact they're vanishingly small. It's actually high self-esteem and moral idealism - convictions of personal and moral superiority - that drive most acts of evil.

Of course, different kinds of story have different levels of emphasis and psychological complexity, but plot without character is just so much light and sound.

No matter how bedazzling the events of a plot might be, all story is ultimately about character.
#narrative 

Harnessing the energy of the dramatic question means understanding that the answer is now easily found.

Fabrication of stories, he adds, 'is one of the key businesses in which our brain engages. Brains do this with the single minded goal of getting the multifaceted actions fo the democracy to make sense.'
