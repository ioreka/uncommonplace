Plants give us every breath of oxygen that fills our lungs, make their food out of thin air in a process called photosynthesis, and are the original source of every mouthful we eat. They are the lynchpin of all life on earth and the ultimate survivors, managing to thrive in even the harshest conditions in practically every corner of the globe. Trees can weigh in at over 2,000 tonnes and can live to be over 5,000 years old. Some Great Basin bristlecone pine trees (_Pinus longaeva_) were alive even before Egypt's pyramids were built.

We are blind to so much of what plants do simply because they live on a different timescale to us.

Like animals, all plants can smell - and even have a nose for lurking danger. When under attack from an infection or pest they can emit aromas of distress, alerting neighbours or triggering their immune systems to ready for battle. Fruits use ethylene gas as a ripening signal, so they ripen simultaneously for maximum appeal to passing animals.

Psychiatrists and psychologists have found that gardening offers a safe place to learn how to care for something outside of ourselves when we have suffered past hurts and traumas. Some plants can sting or have thorns, but they are never angry and will not bite back.

A pond is the single greatest encouragement to wildlife a gardener can provide.

Decades of research has shown that even the plainest of gardens can be a home to a galaxy of life: over 8,000 species of insect alone were detected over a thirty-year period in one modest-sized English garden. 

Worms and an army of other invertebrates are just some of the decomposers that recycle dead plants and animals, fallen leaves, and all of nature's waste into nutrients that sustain plant growth. Flying invertebrates - bees, flies, wasps, beetles, moths, and butterflies - pollinate over 80 per cent of all flowering plants on Earth, enabling fruit and seed production and helping to guarantee you a good crop of peaches, apples, and melons, to name but a few.

In a garden, everyone has the freedom to be a designer, artist, technician, and scientific observer - your own space in the world to plant, prune, and use as you please.

Throughout history gardening has meant taming nature to create a world quite unlike the one in which plants evolved. Outside gardens, the wild plants you see create a constantly changing tapestry, woven by evolution and the daily battle for survival.

Clay particles clog pores between sand and silt, impeding drainage and causing waterlogging. But they readily form larger peds with organic matter that can help improve soil structure. Clay soil can retain 10-100 times more nutrients than sand and silt, giving it the potential to be fabulously fertile and allow plants to thrive.

Clear window glass filters sunlight, removing most of the highest energy (ultraviolet) photons, so even on a bright windowsill, plants receive much less energy for photosynthesis than they would do outdoors.

Roots love being in soil, where they can explore for water and nutrients, aided by helpful soil bacteria and fungi. Living in a container puts a stop to that and calls on the grower to meet a plant's needs instead.

Manufacturing fertilizers for garden plants is a multi-billion dollar industry, yet in nature plants thrive because nutrients are recycled when leaves fall, plants and animals die, and creatures poop. The soil food web is the ultimate recycling machine: one creature's faeces is another's breakfast; one dead carcass is a feast for a thousand tiny mouths. Nothing is wasted and all the soil nutrients upon which plants depend, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium, are replenished in forms ready for roots to take up.

All life is designed to reproduce itself. Male and female animals unite their sperm and eggs, producing young that combine their parents' DNA. Plants follow less rigid rules, and have a far weirder and more wonderful sex life than you might imagine.

The resplendent golden yellows, sunset oranges, and fiery reds that herald autumn have been there all along - a kaleidoscope of colour hidden under a veil of green.
