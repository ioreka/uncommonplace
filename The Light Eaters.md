For everything that science does know about what, biologically, is going on here, there is so much more it cannot yet explain. All around me are complex adaptive systems. Each creature is folded into layers of interrelationship with surrounding creatures that cascade from the largest to the smallest scale. The plants with the soil, the soil with its microbes, the microbes with the plants, the plants with the fungi, the fungi with the soil. The plants with the animals that graze on them and pollinate them. The plants with each other. The whole beautiful mess defies categorization.

At the grand scale, no one seems to have yet won. All parties are still here, animals, plants, fungi, bacteria. What we end up with is a soft of balance in constant motion. All of this pushing and pulling and coalescing, I have some to understand, is a sign of tremendous biological activity. 

Plants are the very definition of creative becoming: they are in constant motion, albeit slow motion, probing the air and soil in a relentless quest for a livable future.

Plants have, other the course of years of obsession, transformed my understanding of what life means, and what its possibilities are. Now as I gaze around the Hoh Rain Forest I see more than a soothing wash of green. I see a masterclass in living to one's fullest, weirdest, most resourceful potential.

If plants can do things we consider indications of intelligence in animals, this group says, then it's illogical, a sign of unreasonable zoocentric bias, not to use that language for them. Others go farther, suggesting that plants may be conscious. Consciousness is perhaps the least understood phenomenon in human beings, let alone other organisms. But a brain, this camp says, may be but one way to build a mind.
Other botanists are more circumspect, unwilling to apply what they see as distinctly animal-centric notions to plants. Plants, after all, are their own clade of life, with an evolutionary history that swerved away from our own long ago. Painting them with our concepts of intelligence and consciousness does a disservice to their essential plantness.

For us to truly be part of this world, to be awake to its roiling aliveness, we need to understand plants. They suffuse our atmosphere with the oxygen we breathe, and they quite literally build our bodies out of sugars they spin from sunlight. They made the ingredients that first allowed our lives to blink into existence at all. Yet they are not merely utilitarian supply machines. They have complex, dynamic lives of their own - social lives, sex lives, and a whole suits of subtle sensory appreciations we mostly assume to be only the domain of animals. What's more, they sense things we can't even imagine, and occupy a world of information we can't see. Understanding plants will unlock a new horizon of understanding for humans: that we share our planet with and owe our lives to a form of life cunning in its own right, at once alien and familiar.

Humans have been able to point to an octopus for all of history and call it an octopus. But we didn't know, until recently, that ocuposes could taste with their arims, use tools, remember faces, see their world far moresensitively than we can ours; that they have neurons distributed though their bodies like a multitude of disparate miniature brains. So, then, what is an octopus? Something much more than we ever imagined.

Ferns, being extremely ancient, can have up to 720 pairs of chromosomes, versus humans' mere 23, which explained why the genomic revolution took so long to reach them.
#complexity #plants 

"Nature everywhere speaks to man in a voice that is familiar to his soul," Von Humboldt wrote; "Everything is interactional and reciprocal," and there fore nature "gives the impression of the whole." Humboldt went ont to introduce the European intellectual world to the concept of the plant as a living whole, with climactic systems and interlocking biological and geological patterns bound up as a "net-like, intricate fabric." This was Western science's earliest glimmer of ecological thinking, where the natural world became a series of biotic communities, each acting upon the others.

A resurrection fern grows on the branches of oak trees, and can almost completely dehydrate in times of drought, shrinking down into a dead-looking crisp. It can remain in its dried state for more than a hundred years and still fully rehydrate. Tree ferns can grow more than sixty-five feet high, and other ferns are minuscule fertilizer factories, like the tiny azolla. And then there's bracken fern, which makes cows who dare to graze on it bleed internally to death. "Just a totally cruel fern," Moran said.

Ferns are much, much older evolutionarily than flowering plants. They appeared on the scene even before evolution dreamed the concept of seeds; they reproduce without them.

Recently, as I came across in my reading, researchers had found promising indicators of memory in plants. Others found that a wide variety of plants are able to distinguish themselves from others, and can tell whether or not those others are genetic kin. When such plants find themselves beside their sibling, they rearrange their leaves within two days to avoid shading them. Pea shoot roots appears to be able to hear water flowing through sealed pipes and grow toward them, and several plants, including lima beans and tobacco, can react to an attack of munching insects by summoning those insects' specific predators to come pick them off. (Other plants - including a particular tomato - secrete a chemical that cause hungry caterpillars to turn away from devouring their leaves to eat each other instead.)

In _The Ecology of Imagination in Childhood_, the writer and researcher Edith Cobb spends two decades investigating the role of nature in the early thinking of children. She finds that children have an "open-system attitude" that allows them a certain emotional proximity to the natural world. "For the young child, the eternal questioning of the nature of the real is largely a wordless dialectic between self and world," she writes.

Science is a conservative institution for a reason. Conservatism is a crucial backstop against false knowledge.
#truth #knowledge #science #the-scientific-method 

Science, for all its strengths, is constrained to the sort of questions that can be answered using the conservative method. The meaning or definition of life is arguably not one of them. Left to the sciences, which were never built to take up ethical questions of being and nonbeing, plants remain conceptually locked out in the inanimate cold. Yet here were all these scientists valiantly trying to engage with the hardest question of all, the very nature of being alert to the world; the hard problem of consciousness.
#consciousness 

There has always been an extreme tendency in popular culture to layer simple human narratives on other species, as seen in virtually every fairy tale or animated film.

It was a good story, too good to stay locked in the obscure realms of academia. I began to feel like it could change the world. Certainly it was already changing mine.
#stories 

A billion and a half years after that first creation, plants have evolved and proliferated into a half million species that thrive in every ecosystem on the planet. Their supremacy is absolute. If weighed, plants would amount to 80% of Earth's living matter.

When plants climbed out of the ocean some five hundred million years ago, they arrived in a terrestrial barrens enveloped in an inhospitable fog of carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Inhospitable, that is, to everything but plants. They had already learned to unlock oxygen from the carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean. They adapted the technology to their new world. In a way, they brought the ocean up with them. By incessantly breathing out, those legions of early land plants tipped the balance of gases towards oxygenation. They created the atmosphere we now enjoy. iIt's not a stretch to say they birthed the habitable world.

Through the same process, plants have made every iota of sugar we have ever consumed. A leaf is the only thing in our known world that can manufacture sugar out of materials - light and air - that have never been alive. All the rest of us are secondary users, recycling the stuff the plant has made. Our recombinations may be genius, they the matter is not original. the original is made like this: As photons from the sun fall upon a plant's outstretched green parts, chloroplasts in the leaf cell convert the particle of light into chemical energy. This solar power gets stored inside specialized energy-storing modules, the rechargeable battery packs of the plant world.

We are made of glucose, too. Without a constant supply of the plant sugar, our vital functions would quickly cease. Think about it: every animal organ was built with sugar from plants. The meat of our bones and indeed the bones themselves carry the signature of their molecules. Our bodies are fabricated with the threads of material plants first spun. Likewise, every thought that has ever passed through your brain was made possible by plants. 
This is crushingly literal. The brain in particular is a machine run chiefly on glucose. Without a continual source of glucose, communication between neurons will slow and then cease. Memory, learning, and thinking will shut down. Without glucode, your brain will wither, shortly before you do. All the glucose in the world, whether it arrives in your body packaged inside a banana or a slice of wheat bread, was manufactured out of thin air in the moments after photons from the sun fell upon it. 
in this way we are, at every moment, brought into conversation with plants, and they with us. Our thoughts, and the products of them - the fabric of our cultures, the direction of our invention - have behind them trillions of plant bodies, each alchemizing the world into existence.

Perhaps a plant's biggest achievement is its anatomical decentralization. A plant is modular; snap off a leaf, and it can grow a new one. Without a central nervous system to protect, the plants' vital organs are distributed and come in duplicate. 

It's fair to say that most people have little feeling toward rare plants, and fewer have any idea of the fight going on to bring them back from the brink. While the average person can differentiate between several different types of canine, they are far less likely to know a beech from a birch, or an ear of wheat from an ear of rye. This is understandable; plants are much further down from us evolutionarily, having evolved in a context so unlike our own. They make food out of light and grow rooted to one spot, spending decades or centuries probing their environments for sustenance. Their way of life is so alien as to often preclude them in our imagination from even having a way of life.

One of plants' greatest strengths is that they can regrow virtually any amputated part, but when a leaf grows back, it always grows back differently. The root cap is the only part to grow back exactly the same.

In _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_, Thomas Kuhn draws the history of science not as a picture of linear progress, with new discoveries building on old ones, but rather as a series of abrupt paradigm shifts within specific fields, in which a set of conditions align to provoke a scientific crisis and shirt form one system of thinking to another. The crisis, here, is the important part.

Sometime after the age of the philosopher-naturalists, of Humboldt and Darwin, science became a pursuit of specialization. Despite relatively recent gestures toward interdisciplinary academics, we still live in an era of specialists, each of whom only sees their own narrow band within the larger problem of how life works. This has produced tremendous leaps in knowledge; with specialization comes depth. Yet for the most part, each specialist remains unaware of the larger picture. Maybe when dealing with plants, this is a formular for ignorance; a plant is a multidimentional organism in constant biological conversation with its surroundings, the bacteria, fungi, insects, minerals, and other plants that make its world. It is no wonder then that zoologists and entomologists have been the ones to make some of the most groundbreaking discoveries about plants, often by viewing them through the lens of animals and insects. That's not to knock botanists, but in an age where genetics dominate, many have ceased to see the plant as a pulsating while, and instead see it as an amalgam of genetic switches and protein gate.s Of course, a human could also be seen in such terms. But what is missed by looking that way?

Academics, armed with hyperliteracy, can be vicious when they disagree.

Even the human brain, as centralized a processing center for our bodies as it may be, appears rather less clearly centralized within itself. When neuroccientists peer inside the brain, they find a distributed network. No discernible command post exists. Our own intelligence appears to emerge from a network of specialized brain cells exchanging infiormation, but they do not appear to answer to some governing force. the intelligent decisions we make emanate not from one specific plance but from a sort of network, a consoludated city of interconnected, communicative parts in our skulls.

Kuhn said that a scientific paradigm shift has the power to change one's view of the world in which we live. "Of course, the world itself stays the same."

The language of scent, they said, was wafting messages on the air.

Communication implies a recognition of self and what lies beyond - the existence of other selves. Communication is the forming of threads between individuals. It's a way to make one life useful to other lives, to make oneself important to other selves. It turns individuals into a community. If it is true that a whole field or forest is in communication, it changes the nature of that forest or field. It changes the notion of what a plant _is_. What is a plant without a means to communicate? A husk. And without conversation, a forest is not a forest.
#communication 

Communication is another of many basic life processes without an agreed-upon scientifici defintion.

When cells talk, big things happen.

Baldwin - the scent of cut grass is the chemical equivalent of a plant's scream. 

Nature, never a flat plane, always has more folds and faces still hidden from human view. The world is a prism, not a window. Wherever we look, we find new refractions.
#perspective 

At the time of my visit, Finnish evolutionary ecologist Aino Kalske, Japanese chemical ecologist Kaori Shiojiri, and Cornell chemical ecologist Andre Kessler had recently found that goldenrods that live in peaceful areas without much threat from predators will issue checmical alarm calls that are incredibly specific - decipherable only to their close kin - on the rare occasion they are attacked. But goldenrods in more hostile territory signal to their neighbours using chemical phrases easily understood by all the goldenrod in the area, not just their biological kin. Instead of using coded whisper networks, these goldenrod broadcast over the loudspeaker, so to speak. 

I thought about what this meant for plants. Now that this  has been found in more than one species, it is safe to assume it will be found in others, and may even extend throughout the plant kingdom. That means plants could be said to have dialects, and are alert to their contexts enough to know when to deploy them. More than that, they have a clear sense of who is who; who is family, who is not. They are in touch with their surroundings, and with the fluctuating status of their enemies. Their communication is not just rudimentary but complex and layered, alive with meanings.

I ask Karban how all his work has changed how he sees plants. "People ask me, do plants feel pain?" he says in response. But the question misses the point. "Plants know they're being eaten. They probably experience it very differently than we do. They're very aware of their environment, they're very sensitive organisms. And the things they care about are very different from what we care about. They know when I am bending over them and casting a shadow. And it's ridiculous to think they'd prefer classical to rock," he says. "But they are sensitive to acoustics."

From a certain perspective, a plant is a sack of water - or slightly more specifically, a skinlike sack of cells, each inflated by a coursing watery liquid. (Same with us, by the way.) That arrangement makes plants extremely electrically conductive.

Technology has evolved to dramatically that, with minimal investment, anyone can observe electricity in plants at home. You only need an electrode and something with which to read its output. If you attach the electrode to your wrist, a steady line of spikes and swoops will appear. If you attach that same electrode to your houseplant's leaf, and touch it in any way, a spike and swoop will appear on the readout that looks remarkably similar. These are action potentials - little bursts of electricity - produced in your case by the neurons in your heart firing at regular intervals to make is pump blood, and in the plant's case - well, no one yet quite knows why they're there, or what for.

That is quite literally the essence of the entire question of plant intelligence: How does something without a brain coordinate a response to any stimuli at all?

Some plants will pump out bitter tannins in a bid to taste disgusting. Others will manufacture their own insect repellant, which in many cases is the bit of the plant humans most enjoy - it's the rich oregano oil in oregano, the sharp spice in a horseradish root. 

And it could be wildly useful in agriculture, if scientists can find the right application. After all, in Appel's work, a sound cue causes the plant to make its own pesticide. If plants could be made to produce pesticides though simply playing sounds to them, it could reduce or eliminate the need for synthetic pesticides on farms, and in some cases increase the levels of compounds that the crop in question is grown for. In a crop like mustard, for example, the plant's own pesticide is the very thing it is farmed for - mustard oil. Putting a lavender bush on high alert by playing the right sounds would cause it to make more of the defensive compounds we prize in lavender oil.

The flower was acting like an amplifier, its whole form like a sort of resonance speaker. The team then plucked off a few petals, breaking the flower's perfect bowl, and retested the flowers; this time, it was unable to resonate at the bee frequency. The flower, in this case, was definitely the part of the plant responsible for "hearing" - and it suggests that it had taken on the bowl shape for exactly the reason satellite dishes are concave. "We found a potential hearing organ, which is the flower itself." When she looks at flowers now, she sees ears everywhere.

Already, scientists have found compelling evidence that language is not entirely confined to the human realm; prairie dogs appear ot use adjectives, specific repeated sounds they used to describe the size, shape, color, and speed of predators. Japanese great tits have syntax, they use distinct strings of chirps to instruct their comrades to scan for danger, ot tell them to move closer. We've heard about songbirds using backchannels for alarm calls, and risk averse chipmunks screaming at the slightest spook. Perhaps it would be small-minded of us to foreclose on the possibility of a sound-based plant language emerging too.

Gagliano spoke at Dartmouth in early 2020, about humbling ourselves as humans: "We are the new kids on the block. Traditionally, you should pay respect to the elders," by which she meant bacteria, fungi, and plants. She called the view of humanity at the top of an evolutionary chain "arrogant" and "juvenile".

Max Weigend and Tilo Henning discovered that _Nasa poissoniana_ were able to remember the time intervals between bumblebee visits, and anticipate the next time their pollinator was likely to arrive.

What good was all that sensation without the ability to remember it? Without memory, very little can be done intelligently. Memories give us the capacity to learn, and to orient ourselves in space and time. What would it mean if a plant could remember? Not the genetic sort of memory, of birds returning to the same migratory grounds each year, but individual memory. Elastic memory. Memories that change when circumstances do.
#memory 

Weigend discoered that plants in the Loasaceae family use the same ingredients to make their stinging hairs as humans and animals use to make their teeth. This is advantageous, because stinging is tough work; the hairs are built precisely like hypodermic needles, and have to be hard enough to piece the exoskeleton of their enemy and inject them with their stinging toxin. 

Memory has long been tangled up with how we think of our own consciousness. Our "sense of pastness", as it is sometimes called, fills out the awareness of ourselves as beings who move through time. Memories are the backbone of the narratives we tell ourselves about ourselves; nothing could be more essential to conscious experience.

Memory, even in humans, is still shrouded in mystery. Neurobiologists have found ways to "see" certain human memories on brain scans, as particular connections of neurons, but many more are yet invisible to science. And then there are the memories which the human body keeps but which have nothing to do with neurons at all. Our immune cells remember pathogens, and draw on those memories to respond next time they appear. Epigenetic memories in calls can be passed down through human generations; we now know the toll of stress and trauma - as well as exposure to things like air pollution - travels down the bloodline to children and grandchildren, potentially impacting things like inflammation markers. 

Memory is a tricky thing to parse.

The remarkable thing about vernalization is that it means plants remember. The term undisputedly applies: plants use information stored about the past to make decisions for the future. This isn't a singlular example Plants take note of the length of a day and the position of the sun. Cornish mallow, a pink-flowered plant, will turn its leaves hours before sunrise to face the horizon in exactly the direction it expects the sun to rise. The movement itself originates in the tissue at the base of its stalk, where the mallow will adjest the pressure of the water flowing through it to bend in the desired direction. 

The fact that a brain produces the experience of "mind" is not explained by its mere physical existence.
#paradox 

Our brains are centralized and compact, perfect for animals that must travel and take their wits with them. What if instead of hunting, our food was sunlight that rained down on us, so we were bathed in it, and we ahd to evolve on the be prepared to recieve it? Instead of a compact and portable brain, we might instead have evolved a limitless ability to build new arms covered in mouths on short notice. 

Motion and experience seem naturally coupled. Move, and new experiences open themselves to you. It makes sense to be able to record these inputs and put them to our own private quest to thrive. This is the birth of learning. 
#growth #growth-mindset #pursuit-of-knowledge 

If plants can't do something for themselves, they find other living things that can do it for them. But when those other things are living creatures with their own agendas, that make take a little bribing - or manipulations. Legumes, for example, form associations with bacteria in their roots to lock in a steady supply of nitrogen fertilizer. Their roots are string with round nodules ilke lopsided pearls that serve as homes for the bacterial colonies. The bacteria in the nodules fix nitrogen in the soil for plants, and the plants feed them sugars in return. But this arrangement doesn't always work out as well as the legume might hope. The bacteria are fickle; they don't always do the job, or do it well. Their ability to fix nitrogen varies widely. The legume monitors the symbioonts living in each of its nodules, making sure they keep their side of the bargain, demanding a 1:1 exhcange. If the plant catches the bacteria free-riding, it punishes the delinquient bacteria by choking off the oxygen supply to that specific nodule.

Beauty is almost always a form of communication. Namely, it communicates "choose me".

Flowers themselves evolved in order to be beautiful to animals.

There is something decidedly queer in all of this - the orchids and aspens and strawberries and antplants and ginkgoes - a sense of sensual entanglement that disregards binaries, runs across the species boundary, and almost gleefully defies heteronormative modes of reproduction. This lens might also help us escape the idea that everything in nature is a battle, with a clear winner. Sometimes it may be an improvisation, or a collaboration, or something else entirely.

What is the difference between a single mega-organism and a community?

In the early 1900s, Soviet agronomist Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov discovered a strange phenomenon: weeds in crop fields sometimes begin to look like the crop themselves. 
Vavlovian mimicry is now a basic fact of agriculture. Oats are a product of the same process; they also got their start mimicking wheat.

The question becomes, in what other ways are they influencing us? A fleet of humans carefully tending to a field of crops can certainly start to look like an army of plant symbionts, diligently serving the plants' needs. I think about Vavlovian mimicry: we didn't domesticate oats, they domesticated us. When I look at a field of cabbage or pumpkin or blueberries, I wonder: Have they conscripted a symbiont, and is that symbiont us?

"I think the plants are the primary organisms, and we are the secondary ones. We are fully dependent on them. Without them, we would not be able to survive," Baluska says. "The opposite situation would not be so drastic for them."

Vision is fundamentally the perception of light and shadow. Objects become visible to us and other animals when they reflect light back to us. Colour, too, is a basic trick of light: it emerges when an object absorbs certain wavelengths of light but not others, reflecting those back to our eyes, determining the colour we see it as. Green leaves, for example, appear green because they absorb red and blue wavelengths, returning to our eyes only the green. Chlorophyll in the plant eats that red light to convert the CO2 and water it absorbs into sugary food; this is photosynthesis. 

This sort of interspecies mimicry calls into the question the belief that different species are fundamentally different. Yes, in some ways they are. But what is one can functionally become the other with a few tweaks? Categories begin to falter. Lines between species become less absolute. Taxonomy might start to look more like the invention of categories than the discovery of them. 
#social-constructs 

Plants with more access to resources are known to be more plastic, pulling out all their behavioural stops. A plant with more sunlight or nutrients can be, in a way, a fuller version of itself.
#privilege 

In other words, our microbes might mediate how we think and feel. Our own cells are likely outnumbered by our microbial tenants. On closer examination, our individuality - what makes us ourselves - may look quite a bit more like a contained democracy than an autonomous dictatorship.

It's been a named rule in animal behavioural science since the 1960s: Hamilton's rule states that you will behave preferentially toward your family members, so long as the cost to your own well-being doesn't exceed the benefit to your shared genetic line. 

This also means that a willingness to help family exists on a sliding scale according to your degree of relatedness. Or, as British biologist JBS Haldane was rumoured to have declared, "I would lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins."

Conservatism in science is both a safety measure against false ideas and the thorn in the side of new breakthroughs. 

Within a decade, evidence to support Dudley's work began flowing in. In 2017 in Argentina a researcher found that sunflower farmers could get up to 47% more oil yield rom their plants if they grew them in rows with kin closely packed next to one another. They grew at densities unheard of in sunflower faming, but instead of attacking each other underground, as closely-grown sunflowers were assume to always do, they did the opposite: aboveground, the sunflowers tilted their stalks at alternating angles to avoid shading their kin-neighbours. There was no sign that they were robbing each other of nutrients, either. 

Fungi, existing in the dark, can't photosynthesise. So they get their supply of life-sustaining carbon from their plant associates, who spend all day making carbon-rich sugars and fats out of sunlight and air. In exchange, fungo supply plants with soil minerals like phosphorus, copper, and zinc that they mine from rock and decomposing material, which plants need but can't always get on their own.

"It's not that I see plants and humans as analogous, they're just outcomes of the same thing. Natural selection doesn't care what taxa you are." Cahill

Genes are the current standin for the code to life. But increasingly it seems like they're less akin to a code that the organism reads out than to a flexible repertoire, a choose-your-own-adventure novel with a multiplicity of endings, each influenced by a million subtle changes in the storyline.

In Sultan's undergrad years at Princeton University, she studied history and philosophy of science, which cemented in her the awareness that science is not objective, and scientific paradigms come and go, each with their own blind spots and biases. "Science is not the objective accumulation of facts," she says. "The ways of thinking that scientists use are things that scientists invent."

All biology, I begin to understand, is ecology.

In 2019, Cahill and researcher Megan Ljubotina found that sunflowers will take note of their social environment to decide where to place their roots.

Coexistence appeared to be a stronger urger for the sunflowers than competition.

In the grasslands in Canada that Cahill has studied for decades, he knows there are species that seem to prefer growing together. They form multispecies "neighbourhoods". It doesn't seem like mere tolerance; they actively seek each other out. they are, Cahill says, coexisting. Coexistance is a powerful concept; it doesn't quite have a place in Dawrinian schema of ruthelsss competition driving all changes in life.

Perhaps our "essence" was more flexible than we thought. Perhaps it was contiguous with, and not separate from, our envinroment.

Plants remind us that we are contiguous with out envinroment, impacted by its every fluctuation, impacts that reverberate through our lineage. Our envinronment shapes our lives and the lives of our descnendents. We inherit their invornment in bodily form. One could say we inherit the earth.

Invasive species have often been maligned as more aggressive, ruthlessly competitive. These are strangely moralizing concepts to put on a plant, when you think about it. The words we use for invasic species are often very unsubtle in their xenophobia, matching nativist language. We call them "aliens" and drape tropes on them about being unnatural in their abilities, aggressive by nature, like diseases on the land. But waht if they're just more resoucrceful, more plastic, better at handling change, and passing on wisdom to their young? 

Once you know that, you can't unknow it. A new moral pocket has opened in your mind.

At what point do we decide that plant communication qualifies as language? What would it do to our own minds if we decide it does?

When Myers asked a researcher whether she thought plant straucture could be considered analogous to the human nervous system, the researcher said no. She thinks trying to use human language for plants "cheapens plants" because it a"assumes we are the ultimate being." Instead, plants are far more advanced than humans in multiple categories. Take the remakrable fact that they can produce complex chemicals, like caffeine. "These are skills we don't have," the researcher says. Comparing them to humans erases those capacites.

Plants in Indigienous philosohpy and cosmology are often literal relatives and ancestors. Indigenous Maya peple in present-day Mexico believe the first people were made from corn.

The wellbeing of plant communities globally now depends on human attitudes toward them. Now that we can see plants as individuals, we have learned to see them on their own terms. Perhaps now we can fold that special admiration back into the larger whole. Biologically, their value lies in their function as members of interrelated communities, the rich, interspecific interactions that hold up the world, the one in which we are all a part.
